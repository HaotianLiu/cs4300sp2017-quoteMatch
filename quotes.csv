2838,Kahlil Gibran,"My friends and my road-fellows, pity the nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion. Pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave, eats a bread it does not harvest, and drinks a wine that flows not from its own winepress. Pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero, and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful. Pity the nation that raises not its voice save when it walks in a funeral, boasts not except among its ruins, and will rebel not save when its neck is laid between the sword and the block. Pity the nation whose statesman is a fox, whose philosopher is a juggler, and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking.

Pity the nation divided into fragments, each fragment deeming itself a nation."

It does not follow that every item which we confidently accept as physical knowledge has actually been certified by the Court our confidence is that it would be certified by the Court if it were submitted. But it does follow that every item of physical knowledge is of a form which might be submitted to the Court. It must be such that we can specify (although it may be impracticable to carry out) an observational procedure which would decide whether it is true or not. Clearly a statement cannot be tested by observation unless it is an assertion about the results of observation. Every item of physical knowledge must therefore be an assertion of what has been or would be the result of carrying out a specified observational procedure."

2911,George Orwell,"It is a commonplace that the history of civilisation is largely the history of weapons. In particular, the connection between the discovery of gunpowder and the overthrow of feudalism by the bourgeoisie has been pointed out over and over again. And though I have no doubt exceptions can be brought forward, I think the following rule would be found to be generally true that ages in which the dominant weapon is expensive or difficult to make will be ages of despotism, whereas when the dominant weapon is cheap and simple, the common people have a chance. Thus, for example, tanks, battleships and bombing planes are inherently tyrannical weapons, while rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic weapons. A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple weapon --so long as there is no answer to it-- gives claws to the weak."

2936,Norman Mailer,"Once a newspaper touches a story, the facts are lost forever, even to the protagonists."
2937,Norman Mailer,Every moment of one's existence one is growing into more or retreating into less.
2938,Norman Mailer,One thing I've learned in all these years is not to make love when you really don't feel it there's probably nothing worse you can do to yourself than that.
2939,Ethel Barrymore,"For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of a Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a MaCaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros."

2949,Benjamin Disraeli,"Courage is fire, and bullying is smoke."
2950,Benjamin Disraeli,Never complain and never explain.
2951,Benjamin Disraeli,"Like all great travellers, I have seen more than I remember, and remember more than I have seen."

5743,Francis Bacon,"Houses are built to live in, not to look on therefore, let use be preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had."
5744,Francis Bacon,"They are ill discoverers that think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea."

5746,Francis Bacon,In charity there is no excess.
5747,Francis Bacon,There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.
5748,Bruce Sterling,"I used to think that cyberspace was fifty years away. What I thought was fifty years away, was only ten years away. And what I thought was ten years away... it was already here. I just wasn't aware of it yet."
5749,Frank Moore Colby,"Every man ought to be inquisitive through every hour of his great adventure down to the day when he shall no longer cast a shadow in the sun. For if he dies without a question in his heart, what excuse is there for his continuance"
5750,Frank Moore Colby,I know of no more disagreeable situation than to be left feeling generally angry without anybody in particular to be angry at.
5751,Frank Moore Colby,Many people lose their tempers merely from seeing you keep yours.
5752,Frank Moore Colby,"Minds do not act together in public they simply stick together and when their private activities are resumed, they fly apart again."
5753,Frank Moore Colby,Persecution was at least a sign of personal interest. Tolerance is composed of nine parts apathy to one of brotherly love.
5754,Frank Moore Colby,"Clever people seem not to feel the natural pleasure of bewilderment, and are always answering questions when the chief relish of a life is to go on asking them."
5755,Frank Moore Colby,Every improvement in communication makes the bore more terrible.

5762,John Burroughs,The spirit of man can endure only so much and when it is broken only a miracle can mend it.
5763,John Burroughs,Nature teaches more than she preaches. There are no sermons in stones. It is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral.
5764,John Burroughs,Science has done more for the development of western civilization in one hundred years than Christianity did in eighteen hundred years.
5765,John Burroughs,The lesson which life repeats and constantly enforces is 'look under foot.' You are always nearer the divine and the true sources of your power than you think.
5766,John Burroughs,"The very idea of a bird is a symbol and a suggestion to the poet. A bird seems to be at the top of the scale, so vehement and intense his life. . . . The beautiful vagabonds, endowed with every grace, masters of all climes, and knowing no bounds -- how many human aspirations are realised in their free, holiday-lives -- and how many suggestions to the poet in their flight and song"
5767,John Burroughs,It is always easier to believe than to deny. Our minds are naturally affirmative.
5768,John Burroughs,"The tendinous part of the mind, so to speak, is more developed in winter the fleshy, in summer. I should say winter had given the bone and sinew to literature, summer the tissues and the blood."
5769,Robert W. Sarnoff,Finance is the art of passing currency from hand to hand until it finally disappears.
5770,John Leonard,The rich are different from you and me because they have more credit.
5771,Arnold Palmer,"I've always made a total effort, even when the odds seemed entirely against me. I never quit trying I never felt that I didn't have a chance to win."
5772,Arnold Palmer,Concentration comes out of a combination of confidence and hunger.
5773,Enid Bagnold,Judges don't age time decorates them.
5774,Leon Jaworski,From Watergate we learned what generations before us have known our Constitution works. And during Watergate years it was interpreted again so as to reaffirm that no one - absolutely no one - is above the law.

5776,Mark Russell,"The way money goes so fast these days, they should paint racing stripes on it."
5777,James Brady,"For target shooting, that's okay. Get a license and go to the range. For defense of the home, that's why we have police departments."
5778,James Brady,It is not a loss of freedom. It's a measure to protect it. on gun control
5779,Milton Berle,"I'd rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star. I'd rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far for a might have-been has never been, but a has was once an are."
5780,Milton Berle,Laughter is an instant vacation
5781,Alexander Hamilton,Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.
5782,Alexander Hamilton,"...for it is a truth, which the experience of all ages has attested, that the people are commonly most in danger when the means of insuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion."
5783,Alexander Hamilton,"Men give me credit for some genius. All the genius I have lies in this when I have a subject in hand, I study it profoundly. Day and night it is before me. My mind becomes pervaded with it. Then the effort that I have made is what people are pleased to call the fruit of genius. It is the fruit of labor and thought."
5784,Alexander Hamilton,"The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased."
5785,Alexander Hamilton,"In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it to control itself."
5786,Alexander Hamilton,"Men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike."
5787,Alexander Hamilton,"Power may be justly compared to a great river while kept within its bounds it is both beautiful and useful, but when it overflows its banks, it is then too impetuous to be stemmed it bears down all before it, and brings destruction and desolation wherever it goes."
5788,Alexander Hamilton,"Why has government been instituted at all Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint."
5789,Alexander Hamilton,"A national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing."
5790,Alexander Hamilton,"When men exercise their reason coolly and freely on a variety of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions on some of them. When they are governed by a common passion, their opinions, if they are to be called, will be the same."
5791,Alexander Hamilton,It has been observed that a pure democracy if it were practicable would be the most perfect government. Experience has proved that no position is more false than this. The ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one good feature of government. Their very character was tyranny their figure deformity.
5792,Alexander Hamilton,"Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the stronger and as, in the latter state, even the individuals are prompted, by the uncertainty of their condition, to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves so, in the former state, will the more powerful factions or parties be gradually induced, by a like motive to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful."
5793,Stanley Kubrick,"A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later."
5794,Stanley Kubrick,Chess teaches you to control the initial excitement you feel when you see something that looks good and it trains you to think objectively when you're in trouble.
5795,Stanley Kubrick,"The great nations have always acted like gangsters, and the small nations like prostitutes."
5796,Sir Winston Churchill,The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.
5797,Sir Winston Churchill,Dictators ride to and fro upon tigers which they dare not dismount. And the tigers are getting hungry.
5798,Sir Winston Churchill,To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years. To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.
5799,Sir Winston Churchill,Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.
5800,Sir Winston Churchill,"I am certainly not one of those who need to be prodded. In fact, if anything, I am the prod."
5801,Sir Winston Churchill,The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.
5802,Sir Winston Churchill,The price of greatness is responsibility.
5803,Sir Winston Churchill,"It is no use saying, 'We are doing our best.' You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary."
5804,Sir Winston Churchill,"We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hillswe shall never surrender."

5809,Sir Winston Churchill,"Although prepared for martyrdom, I preferred that it be postponed."
5810,Sir Winston Churchill,I cannot pretend to feel impartial about colours. I rejoice with the brilliant ones and am genuinely sorry for the poor browns.
5811,Sir Winston Churchill,He has all the virtues I dislike and none of the vices I admire.
5812,Sir Winston Churchill,"Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening, ever-ascending, ever-improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the journey. But this, so far from discouraging, only adds to the joy and glory of the climb."
5813,Sir Winston Churchill,I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.
5814,Sir Winston Churchill,History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.
5815,Sir Winston Churchill,"Broadly speaking, the short words are the best, and the old words best of all."
5816,Sir Winston Churchill,A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject.
5817,Sir Winston Churchill,It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.
5818,Sir Winston Churchill,"Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events."
5819,Sir Winston Churchill,Never hold discussions with the monkey when the organ grinder is in the room.
5820,Sir Winston Churchill,"Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened."
5821,Sir Winston Churchill,"Personally I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught."
5822,Sir Winston Churchill,"One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half."
5823,Sir Winston Churchill,Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.
5824,Sir Winston Churchill,It is a mistake to try to look too far ahead. The chain of destiny can only be grasped one link at a time.
5825,Sir Winston Churchill,"I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat."
5826,Sir Winston Churchill,"Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time."
5827,Sir Winston Churchill,"When I am abroad, I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country. I make up for lost time when I come home."
5828,Sir Winston Churchill,"We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give."
5829,Sir Winston Churchill,"When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber."
5830,Sir Winston Churchill,"The reserve of modern assertions is sometimes pushed to extremes, in which the fear of being contradicted leads the writer to strip himself of almost all sense and meaning."
5831,Sir Winston Churchill,"The British nation is unique in this respect. They are the only people who like to be told how bad things are, who like to be told the worst."
5832,Sir Winston Churchill,"There are a terrible lot of lies going around the world, and the worst of it is half of them are true."
5833,Sir Winston Churchill,"Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy and the lash."
5834,Sir Winston Churchill,We shall not fail or falter we shall not weaken or tire...Give us the tools and we will finish the job.
5835,Sir Winston Churchill,Here is the answer which I will give to President Roosevelt... We shall not fail or falter we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give us the tools and we will finish the job.
5836,Sir Winston Churchill,I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.
5837,Sir Winston Churchill,It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations.
5838,Sir Winston Churchill,For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.
5839,Sir Winston Churchill,I am prepared to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.
5840,Sir Winston Churchill,"I am reminded of the professor who, in his declining hours, was asked by his devoted pupils for his final counsel. He replied, 'Verify your quotations.'"
5841,Sir Winston Churchill,"It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations. Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is an admirable work, and I studied it intently. The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts. They also make you anxious to read the authors and look for more."
5842,Sir Winston Churchill,"So they the Government go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent."
5843,Sir Winston Churchill,One day President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once 'The Unnecessary War'.
5844,Sir Winston Churchill,"Never give in--never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy."
5845,Sir Winston Churchill,"A love of tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril but the new view must come, the world must roll forward."

5853,Vincent Van Gogh,"Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well."
5854,Vincent Van Gogh,"If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it. I think that I see something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning and coos or laughs because it sees the sun shining on its cradle."
5855,Vincent Van Gogh,"How can I be useful, of what service can I be There is something inside me, what can it be"
5856,Vincent Van Gogh,One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever come to sit by it. Passersby see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on the way.
5857,Vincent Van Gogh,A good picture is equivalent to a good deed.
5858,Vincent Van Gogh,What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything
5859,Vincent Van Gogh,"It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to. . . . The feeling for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures."
5860,Vincent Van Gogh,"It is better to be high-spirited even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all to prudent."
5861,Vincent Van Gogh,"If one is the master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time insight into and understanding of many things."
5862,Vincent Van Gogh,"Keep your love of nature, for that is the true way to understand art more and more."
5863,Vincent Van Gogh,Do not quench your inspiration and your inmagination do not become the slave of your model.
5864,Vincent Van Gogh,Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.
5865,Vincent Van Gogh,Paintings have a life of their own that derives from the painter's soul.
5866,Vincent Van Gogh,"There may be a great fire in our soul, yet no one ever comes to warm himself at it, and the passers-by see only a wisp of smoke."
5867,Aldous Huxley,Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.

5870,Aldous Huxley,Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.
5871,Aldous Huxley,Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons - that's philosophy.
5872,Aldous Huxley,Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.
5873,Aldous Huxley,"We are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found, and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself."
5874,Aldous Huxley,"Consistency is contrary to nature, contrary to life. The only completely consistent people are dead."
5875,Aldous Huxley,"The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles and mysteries. Nor did they posses a really effective system of mind-manipulation. Under a scientific dictator, education will rea"
5876,Aldous Huxley,"You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but now, as yet, intelligent enough."
5877,Aldous Huxley,Experience teaches only the teachable.
5878,Aldous Huxley,"My fate cannot be mastered it can only be collaborated with and thereby, to some extent, directed. Nor am I the captain of my soul I am only its noisiest passenger."
5879,Aldous Huxley,"After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."
5880,Aldous Huxley,"Abused as we abuse it at present, dramatic art is in no sense cathartic it is merely a form of emotional masturbation. It is the rarest thing to find a player who has not had his character affected for the worse by the practice of his profession. Nobody can make a habit of self-exhibition, nobody can exploit his personality for the sake of exercising a kind of hypnotic power over others, and remain untouched by the process."
5881,Aldous Huxley,"One of the great attractions of patriotism -- it fulfills our worst wishes. In the person of our nation we are able, vicariously, to bully and cheat. Bully and cheat, what's more, with a feeling that we are profoundly virtuous."
5882,Aldous Huxley,"The charm of history and its enigmatic lesson consist in the fact that, from age to age, nothing changes and yet everything is completely different."
5883,Aldous Huxley,Experience is not what happens to a man it is what a man does with what happens to him.

5886,Aldous Huxley,Death  Its the only thing we havent succeeded in completely vulgarizing.
5887,Aldous Huxley,"There's only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self."
5888,Aldous Huxley,Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.
5889,Aldous Huxley,The vast majority of human beings dislike and even dread all notions with which they are not familiar. Hence it comes about that at their first appearance innovators have always been devided as fools and madmen.
5890,Aldous Huxley,"Art is one of the means whereby man seeks to redeem a life which is experienced as chaotic, senseless, and largely evil."
5891,Aldous Huxley,"The finest works of art are precious, among other reasons, because they make it possible for us to know, if only imperfectly and for a little while, what it actually feels like to think subltly and feel nobly."
5892,Aldous Huxley,A man's worst difficulties begin when he is able to do as he likes.
5893,Aldous Huxley,Idealism is the noble toga that political gentlemen drape over their will to power.
5894,Aldous Huxley,"When one's ill or unhappy, one needs something outside oneself to hold one up. It is a good thing, I think, when one has been knocked out of one's balance . to have some external job or duty to hang on to."

5896,Aldous Huxley,It is the customary fate of new truths to begin as heresies and to end as superstitions.
5897,Aldous Huxley,"The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm."
5898,Aldous Huxley,Such prosperity as we have known up to the present is the consequence of rapidly spending the planet's irreplaceable capital.
5899,Aldous Huxley,That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons that history has to teach.
5900,Aldous Huxley,Silence is as full of potential wisdom and wit as the unhewn marble of a great sculpture.
5901,Aldous Huxley,We participate in a tragedy at a comedy we only look.
5902,Aldous Huxley,Never put off till tomorrow the fun you can have today.
5903,Aldous Huxley,"That all men are equal is a proposition which, at ordinary times, no sane individual has ever given his assent."
5904,Aldous Huxley,"The author of the Iliad is either Homer or, if not Homer, somebody else of the same name."
5905,Aldous Huxley,An intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex.
5906,Aldous Huxley,"At least two-thirds of our miseries spring from human stupidity, human malice and those great motivators and justifiers of malice and stupidity idealism, dogmatism and proselytizing zeal on behalf of religous or political ideas."
5907,Aldous Huxley,Happiness is not achieved by the conscious pursuit of happiness it is generally the by-product of other activities.
5908,George McGovern,The Establishment center ... has led us into the stupidest and cruelest war in all history. That war is a moral and political disaster -- a terrible cancer eating away at the soul of our nation.
5909,George McGovern,"It doesn't require any particular bravery to stand on the floor of the Senate and urge our boys in Vietnam to fight harder, and if this war mushrooms into a major conflict and a hundred thousand young Americans are killed, it won't be U. S. Senators who die. It will be American soldiers who are too young to qualify for the senate."
5910,George McGovern,I'm fed up to the ears with old men dreaming up wars for young men to die in.
5911,Rainer Maria Rilke,"The deepest experience of the creator is feminine, for it is experience of receiving and bearing."
5912,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other."
5913,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves ... Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point it, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps, then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer."
5914,Rainer Maria Rilke,"This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love the more they give, the more they possess."
5915,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see each other whole against the sky."
5916,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Do continue to believe that with your feeling and your work you are taking part in the greatest the more strongly you cultivate this belief, the more will reality and the world go forth from it."
5917,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Live your questions now, and perhaps even without knowing it , you will live along some distant day into your answers."
5918,Rainer Maria Rilke,"For one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation."
5919,Rainer Maria Rilke,Live the questions.
5920,Rainer Maria Rilke,"If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it blame yourself, tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches."
5921,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Do not assume that she who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. Her life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, she would never have been able to find these words."
5922,Rainer Maria Rilke,"For one human being to love another human being That is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task"

5925,Clive Staples Lewis,"Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point."
5926,Clive Staples Lewis,"It is hard to have patience with people who say 'There is no death' or 'Death doesn't matter.' There is death. And whatever is matters. And whatever happens has consequences, and it and they are irrevocable and irreversible. You might as well say that birth doesn't matter."
5927,Clive Staples Lewis,Why love if losing hurts so much We love to know that we are not alone.
5928,Clive Staples Lewis,A man's dying is more the survivors' affair than his own.
5929,Clive Staples Lewis,"Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."
5930,Clive Staples Lewis,"Friendship is not necessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value rather it is one of those things that give value to survival."
5931,Clive Staples Lewis,"What I want to fix your attention on is the vast overall movement towards the discrediting, and finally the elimination, of every kind of human excellence -- moral, cultural, social or intellectual. And is it not pretty to notice how 'democracy' (in the incantatory sense) is now doing for us the work that was once done by the most ancient dictatorships, and by the same methods The basic proposal of the new education is to be that dunces and idlers must not be made to feel inferior to intelligent and industrious pupils. That would be 'undemocratic.' Children who are fit to proceed may be artificially kept back, because the others would get a trauma by being left behind. The bright pupil thus remains democratically fettered to his own age group throughout his school career, and a boy who would be capable of tackling Aeschylus or Dante sits listening to his coeval's attempts to spell out A CAT SAT ON A MAT. We may reasonably hope for the virtual abolition of education when 'I'm as good as you' has fully had its way. All incentives to learn and all penalties for not learning will vanish. The few who might want to learn will be prevented who are they to overtop their fellows And anyway, the teachers -- or should I say nurses -- will be far too busy reassuring the dunces and patting them on the back to waste any time on real teaching. We shall no longer have to plan and toil to spread imperturbable conceit and incurable ignorance among men."
5932,Clive Staples Lewis,"Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it."
5933,Clive Staples Lewis,"Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another What You, too Thought I was the only one."
5934,Clive Staples Lewis,"Prosperity knits a man to the world. He thinks he's 'finding his place in it,' while really it is finding its place in him."
5935,Clive Staples Lewis,"What seem our worst prayers may really be, in God's eyes, our best. Those, I mean, which are least supported by devotional feeling. For these may come from a deeper level than feeling. God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when he catches us, as it were, off our guard."
5936,Clive Staples Lewis,Aim at heaven and you will get earth thrown in. Aim at earth and you get neither.
5937,Clive Staples Lewis,"The safest road to hell is the gradual one-the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts."
5938,Clive Staples Lewis,"Some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith but they are afflictions, not sins. Like all afflictions, they are, if we can so take them, our share in the passion of Christ."
5939,Clive Staples Lewis,"A man who is eating or lying with his wife or preparing to go to sleep in humility, thankfulness and temperance, is, by Christian standards, in an infinitely higher state than one who is listening to Bach or reading Plato in a state of pride."
5940,Clive Staples Lewis,"The Future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is."
5941,Clive Staples Lewis,The perfect church service would be the one we were almost unaware of our attention would have been on God. But every novelty prevents this. It fixes our attention on the service itself and thinking about worship is a different thing than worshipping ... 'Tis mad idolatry that makes the service greater than the god.
5942,Clive Staples Lewis,"Just a hurried line...to tell a story which puts the contrast between *our* feast of the Nativity and all this ghastly Xmas racket at it's lowest. My brother heard a woman on a 'bus say, as the 'bus passed a church with a Crib outside it, Oh Lor' They bring religion into everything. Look- they're dragging it even into Christmas now"
5943,Clive Staples Lewis,"When we lose one blessing, another is often, most unexpectedly, given in its place."
5944,Clive Staples Lewis,"Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important."
5945,Clive Staples Lewis,"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
5946,Clive Staples Lewis,"If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth - only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair."
5947,Clive Staples Lewis,It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present in us.
5948,Clive Staples Lewis,"Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements."
5949,Clive Staples Lewis,Friendship is...the sort of love one can imagine between angels.
5950,Clive Staples Lewis,"We may not be able to get certainty, but we can get probability, and half a loaf is better than no bread."
5951,Clive Staples Lewis,I was not born to be free. I was born to adore and to obey.
5952,Hellen Keller,The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
5953,Hellen Keller,"When one door of happiness closes, another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."
5954,Hellen Keller,"No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit."
5955,Hellen Keller,"I am only one but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something I will not refuse to do something I can do."

5959,Hellen Keller,Security is mostly superstition. It does not exist in nature  Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often as the bold.
5960,Hellen Keller,I have always thought it would be a blessing if each person could be blind and deaf for a few days during his early adult life. Darkness would make him appreciate sight silence would teach him the joys of sound.
5961,Hellen Keller,"The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight, but has no vision."
5962,Hellen Keller,"Literature is my Utopia. Here I am not disenfranchised. No barrier of the sense shuts me out from the sweet, gracious discourse of my book friends. They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness."
5963,Hellen Keller,Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
5964,Hellen Keller,"As the eagle was killed by the arrow winged with his own feather, so the hand of the world is wounded by its own skill."

5970,Hellen Keller,"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble."
5971,Hellen Keller,"It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers, but for powers equal to our tasks, to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal."
5972,Hellen Keller,It is better to be happy for a moment and be burned up with beauty than to live a long time and be bored all the while.
5973,Hellen Keller,"One's life story cannot be told with complete veracity. A true autobiography would have to be written in states of mind, emotions, heartbeats, smiles and tears not in months and years, or physical events. Life is marked off on the soul by feelings, not by dates."
5974,Hellen Keller,Not the senses I have but what I do with them is my kingdom.

5982,Hellen Keller,"Toleration is the greatest gift of mind, it requires that same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle."
5983,Hellen Keller,"Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are, we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men. It then appears that we are among the privileged."
5984,Hellen Keller,"Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. 'Light Give me light' was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour."

5986,Hellen Keller,"There is plenty of courage among us for the abstract, but not for the concrete."
5987,Hellen Keller,Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousand of miles and all the years you have lived.

5993,Israel Zangwill,In how many lives does love really play a dominant part The average taxpayer is no more capable of the grand passion than of a grand opera.
5994,Israel Zangwill,The only true love is love at first sight second sight dispels it.
5995,Israel Zangwill,"The Past Our cradle, not our prison there is danger as well as appeal in its glamor. The past is for inspiration, not imitation, for continuation, not repitition."

6008,John W. Gardner,"Leaders come in many forms, with many styles and diverse qualities. There are quiet leaders and leaders one can hear in the next county. Some find strength in eloquence, some in judgment, some in courage."
6009,John W. Gardner,"Josh Billings said, It is not only the most difficult thing to know oneself, but the most inconvenient one, too. Human beings have always employed an enormous variety of clever devices for running away from themselves, and the modern world is particularly rich in such stratagems."
6010,John W. Gardner,"When Alexander the Great visited Diogenes and asked whether he could do anything for the famed teacher, Diogenes replied 'Only stand out of my light.'

6014,John W. Gardner,History never looks like history when you are living through it.
6015,John W. Gardner,The ultimate goal of the educational system is to shift to the individual the burden of pursing his own education. This will not be a widely shared pursuit until we get over our odd conviction that education is what goes on in school buildings and nowhere else.
6016,John W. Gardner,The creative individual has the capacity to free himself from the web of social pressures in which the rest of us are caught. He is capable of questioning the assumptions that the rest of us accept.

6068,William Wordsworth,"Wisdom and spirit of the Universe Thou soul is the eternity of thought That giv'st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion Not in vain By day or star-light thus from by first dawn Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human soul, Not with the mean and vulgar works of man, But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature, purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying, by such discipline Both pain and fear, until we recognize A grandeur in the beatings of the heart."

6075,This Is Spinal Tap,"David I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.

It's like a Mach piece, really. It's sort of - Marty What do you call this Nigel Well, this piece is called Lick My Love Pump."
6080,This Is Spinal Tap,Marty This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growth of this band cannot even be charted. They are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.

6089,Arthur C. Clarke,I don't pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about.

6094,Casino,"Nicky I think in all fairness, I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do. For instance tomorrow morning ill get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and... walk in and see and uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll... crack your f***in' head wide-open in front of everybody in the bank. And just about the time I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma. And guess what I'll split your f***in' head open again. 'Cause I'm f***in' stupid. I don't give a f*** about jail. That's my business. That's what I do."

6097,Casino,"Ace The town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number. After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box, the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids Junk bonds. But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home. And why mess up a good thing"
6098,Casino,"Nicky A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. But you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise, you're talking about a half-hour to forty-five minutes worth of digging. And who knows who's gonna come along in that time Pretty soon, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all f***in' night."
6099,Casino,"Ace When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had."

7455,Douglas MacArthur,"Build me a son, O Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid, one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory."
7456,Douglas MacArthur,"I promise to keep on living as though I expected to live forever. Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul."

7480,Bertrand Russell,There is much pleasure ot be gained from useless knowledge.
7481,Bertrand Russell,"Men are born ignorant, not stupid. They are made stupid by education."
7482,Bertrand Russell,"To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead."
7483,Bertrand Russell,The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.
7484,Bertrand Russell,War does not determine who is right - only who is left.
7485,Bertrand Russell,"The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry."
7486,Bertrand Russell,In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.
7487,Bertrand Russell,"Fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom."

7489,Bertrand Russell,Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.
7490,Bertrand Russell,"Education, which was at first made universal in order that all might be able to read and write, has been found capable of serving quite other purposes. By instilling nonsense it unifies populations and generates collective enthusiasm."
7491,Bertrand Russell,"Real life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity."
7492,Bertrand Russell,"A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation."
7493,Bertrand Russell,"So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence."
7494,Bertrand Russell,"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts."
7495,Bertrand Russell,"The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it."
7496,Bertrand Russell,The main thing needed to make men happy is intelligence.
7497,Bertrand Russell,"Fear is, I believe, a most effective tool in destroying the soul of an individual--and the soul of a people."
7498,Bertrand Russell,"One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity, and credulity could be enormously diminished by instructions as to the prevalent forms of mendacity. Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power."
7499,Bertrand Russell,The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way.

7507,Bertrand Russell,"When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others."
7508,Bertrand Russell,Drunkenness  is temporary suicide.
7509,Bertrand Russell,"It may seem to your conceited to suppose that you can do anything important toward improving the lot of mankind. But this is a fallacy. You must believe that you can help bring about a better world. A good society is produced only by good individuals, just as truly as a majority in a presidential election is produced by the votes of single electors. Everybody can do something toward creating in his own environment kindly feelings rather than anger, reasonableness rather than hysteria, happiness rather than misery."
7510,Bertrand Russell,"'Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind."
7511,Bertrand Russell,The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.

7518,Bertrand Russell,The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
7519,Bertrand Russell,"Boredom is a vital problem for the moralist, since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it."
7520,Bertrand Russell,It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living.
7521,Bertrand Russell,To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.
7522,Bertrand Russell,It is because modern education is so seldom inspired by a great hope that it so seldom achieves great results. The wish to preserve the past rather than the hope of creating the future dominates the minds of those who control the teaching of the young.
7523,Bertrand Russell,"I found one day in school a boy of medium size ill-treating a smaller boy. I expostulated, but he replied 'The bigs hit me, so I hit the babies that's fair.' In these words he epitomized the history of the human race."
7524,Bertrand Russell,The fundamental defect of fathers is that they want their children to be a credit to them.
7525,Bertrand Russell,"Our instinctive emotions are those that we have inherited from a much more dangerous world, and contain, therefore, a larger portion of fear than they should."
7526,Bertrand Russell,The mind is a strange machine which can combine the materials offered to it in the most astonishing ways.
7527,Bertrand Russell,"I think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt. I shouldn't wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine."
7528,Bertrand Russell,"Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day."
7529,Bertrand Russell,"If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence."
7530,Bertrand Russell,"In the part of this universe that we know there is great injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked prosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying."
7531,Bertrand Russell,"If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years."
7532,Bertrand Russell,All movements go too far.
7533,Bertrand Russell,"A stupid man's report of what a clever man says can never be accurate, because he unconciously translates what he hears into something he can understand."
7534,Bertrand Russell,"It is a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won't go."
7535,Bertrand Russell,"Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth -- more than ruin -- more even than death.... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man."
7536,Bertrand Russell,"Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture."
7537,Bertrand Russell,Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.
7538,Bertrand Russell,Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.
7539,Bertrand Russell,"Passive acceptance of the teacher's wisdom is easy to most boys and girls. It involves no effort of independent thought, and seems rational because the teacher knows more than his pupils it is moreover the way to win the favour of the teacher unless he is a very exceptional man. Yet the habit of passive acceptance is a disastrous one in later life. It causes man to seek and to accept a leader, and to accept as a leader whoever is established in that position."
7540,Bertrand Russell,It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.
7541,Bertrand Russell,No one gossips about other people's secret virtues.
7542,Bertrand Russell,Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man.
7543,Bertrand Russell,The people who are regarded as moral luminaries are those who forego ordinary pleasures themselves and find compensation in interfering with the pleasures of others.
7544,Bertrand Russell,"The main things which seem to me important on their own account, and not merely as means to other things, are knowledge, art, instinctive happiness, and relations of frendship or affection."
7545,Bertrand Russell,The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.
7546,Bertrand Russell,"Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination."
7547,Bertrand Russell,"The good life, as I conceive it, is a happy life. I do not mean that if you are good you will be happy - I mean that if you are happy you will be good."
7548,Bertrand Russell,"The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf."
7549,Bertrand Russell,This is one of those views which are so absolutely absurd that only very learned men could possibly adopt them.
7550,Bertrand Russell,"What the world needs is not dogma but an attitude of scientific inquiry combined with a belief that the torture of millions is not desirable, whether inflicted by Stalin or by a Deity imagined in the likeness of the believer."
7551,Bertrand Russell,There is no nonsense so errant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate governmental action.
7552,Bertrand Russell,Too little liberty brings stagnation and too much brings chaos.
7553,Bertrand Russell,This is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.
7554,Bertrand Russell,"Not to be absolutely certain is, I think, one of the essential things in rationality."
7555,Bertrand Russell,"There are two motives for reading a book one, that you enjoy it the other, that you can boast about it."
7556,Bertrand Russell,"Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men although he was twice married, it never occured to him to verify this statement by examining his wives' mouths."
7557,Bertrand Russell,"Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact."
7558,Bertrand Russell,"When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others. It is much more nearly certain that we are assembled here tonight than it is that this or that political party is in the right. Certainly there are degrees of certainty, and one should be very careful to emphasize that fact, because otherwise one is landed in an utter skepticism, and complete skepticism would, of course, be totally barren and completely useless."
7559,Bertrand Russell,"Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness."
7560,Bertrand Russell,"The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible."
7561,Bertrand Russell,"One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways."
7562,Bertrand Russell,"To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level."
7563,Bertrand Russell,"We have, in fact, two kinds of morality side by side one which we preach but do not practice, and another which we practice but seldom preach."
7564,Bertrand Russell,It is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatsoever for supposing it is true.
7565,Bertrand Russell,"It is obvious that 'obscenity' is not a term capable of exact legal definition in the practice of the Courts, it means 'anything that shocks the magistrate.'"
7566,Bertrand Russell,"Man is a credulous animal, and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief, he will be satisfied with bad ones."
7567,George Shultz,"The minute you start talking about what you're going to do if you lose, you have lost."
7568,Timothy Leary,"Civilization is unbearable, but it is less unbearable at the top."
7569,Timothy Leary,You can always pick up your needle and move to another groove.

7586,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"Sympathy constitutes friendship but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole."

7635,Harold Taylor,"A student is not a professional athlete. ... He is not a little politician or junior senator looking for angles ... an amateur promoter, a glad-hander, embryo Rotarian, caf-society leader, quiz kid or man about town.

9216,Albert Einstein,"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."
9217,Albert Einstein,Insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
9218,Albert Einstein,"He who joyfully marches in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice."
9219,Albert Einstein,Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
9220,Albert Einstein,The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.
9221,Albert Einstein,Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.
9222,Albert Einstein,The important thing is not to stop questioning.
9223,Albert Einstein,The hardest thing to understand in the world is the income tax.
9224,Albert Einstein,The problems that exist in the world today cannot be solved by the level of thinking that created them.
9225,Albert Einstein,"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
9226,Albert Einstein,The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.
9227,Albert Einstein,"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."
9228,Albert Einstein,Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.
9229,Albert Einstein,"We should take care not to make the intellect our god it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."
9230,Albert Einstein,"Most people go on living their everyday life half frightened, half indifferent, they behold the ghostly tragi-comedy that is being performed on the international stage before the eyes and ears of the world."
9231,Albert Einstein,"I don't know what kind of weapons will be used in the third world war, assuming there will be a third world war. But I can tell you what the fourth world war will be fought with -- stone clubs."
9232,Albert Einstein,The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while.
9233,Albert Einstein,"I don't know what will be used in the next world war, but the 4th will be fought with stones."
9234,Albert Einstein,My life is a simple thing that would interest no one. It is a known fact that I was born and that is all that is necessary.
9235,Albert Einstein,The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible.
9236,Albert Einstein,What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.
9237,Albert Einstein,It is only to the individual that a soul is given.
9238,Albert Einstein,Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. (said of Mahatma Gandhi)
9239,Albert Einstein,It is the theory that decides what we can observe.
9240,Albert Einstein,"To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me an authority myself."
9241,Albert Einstein,The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.
9242,Albert Einstein,"Our defense is not in our armaments, nor in science, nor in going underground. Our defense is in law and order."
9243,Albert Einstein,Intellectuals solve problems geniuses prevent them.
9244,Albert Einstein,What is inconceivable about the universe is that it is at all conceivable.
9245,Albert Einstein,"I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity."
9246,Albert Einstein,"If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts."
9247,Albert Einstein,"We scientists, whose tragic destiny it has been to make the methods of annihilation ever more gruesome and more effective, must consider it our solemn and transcendent duty to do all in our power in preventing these weapons from being used for the brutal purpose for which they were invented."
9248,Albert Einstein,The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it. Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure.
9249,Albert Einstein,"He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would fully suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is I would rather be torn to shreds than be part of so base an action It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder."
9250,Albert Einstein,"The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder."
9251,Albert Einstein,"If my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world."
9252,Albert Einstein,"Each of us visits this Earth involuntarily, and without an invitation. For me, it is enough to wonder at the secrets."
9253,Albert Einstein,A storm broke loose in my mind.
9254,Albert Einstein,"When the Special Theory of Relativity began to germinate in me, I was visited by all sorts of nervous conflicts... I used to go away for weeks in a state of confusion."
9255,Albert Einstein,We believe that an informed citizenry will act for life and not for death. (on atomic energy)
9256,Albert Einstein,"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty."
9257,Albert Einstein,By academic freedom I understand the right to search for truth and to publish and teach what one holds to be true. This right implies also a duty one must not conceal any part of what on has recognized to be true. It is evident that any restriction on academic freedom acts in such a way as to hamper the dissemination of knowledge among the people and thereby impedes national judgment and action.
9258,Albert Einstein,"No, this trick won't work...How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love"
9259,Albert Einstein,"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."
9260,Albert Einstein,"One had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect on me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year."
9261,Albert Einstein,Why is it that nobody understands me and everybody likes me
9262,Albert Einstein,There has already been published by the bucketfuls such brazen lies and utter fictions about me that I would long since have gone to my grave if I had let myself pay attention to that.
9263,Albert Einstein,"The individual must not merely wait and criticize, he must defend the cause the best he can. The fate of the world will be such as the world deserves."
9264,Albert Einstein,"Emc (Energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light.) Original statement If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminshes by Lc."
9265,Albert Einstein,"To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull facilities can comprehend only in the most primitive forms--this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the ranks of the devoutly religious men."
9266,Albert Einstein,"Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for insects as well as for the stars. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper."
9267,Albert Einstein,"I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb. Perhaps two-thirds of the people of the Earth might be killed, but enough men capable of thinking, and enough books, would be left to start again, and civilization could be restored."
9268,Albert Einstein,"Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world."
9269,Albert Einstein,Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.
9270,Albert Einstein,"Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. It is characteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong. In order to illustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I remarked that only a supranational organization would offer protection from that danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race"
9271,Albert Einstein,"Human beings are not condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate."
9272,Albert Einstein,"All our thoughts and concepts are called up by sense-experiences and have a meaning only in reference to these sense-experiences. On the other hand, however, they are products of the spontaneous activity of our minds they are thus in no wise logical consequences of the contents of these sense-experiences. If, therefore, we wish to grasp the essence of a complex of abstract notions we must for the one part investigate the mutual relationships between the concepts and the assertions made about them for the other, we must investigate how they are related to the experiences."
9273,Albert Einstein,"There was this huge world out there, independent of us human beings and standing before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partly accessible to our inspection and thought. The contemplation of that world beckoned like a liberation."
9274,Albert Einstein,Never regard study as a duty but as an enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later works belong.
9275,Albert Einstein,"I have reached an age when, if someone tells me to wear socks, I don't have to."
9276,Albert Einstein,"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
9277,Albert Einstein,All of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field.
9278,Albert Einstein,"A photograph never grows old. You and I change, people change all through the months and years, but a photograph always remains the same. How nice to look at a photograph of mother or father taken many years ago. You see them as you remember them. But as people live on, they change completely. That is why I think a photograph can be kind."
9279,Albert Einstein,True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist.
9280,Albert Einstein,Those people have seen something. What it is I do not know and I can not care to know. (on flying saucers)
9281,Albert Einstein,"The mere formulation of a problem is far more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skills. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science."
9282,Albert Einstein,"Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us closer to the secret of the 'Old One.' I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice."
9283,Albert Einstein,Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.
9284,Albert Einstein,"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
9285,Albert Einstein,We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
9286,Albert Einstein,Before God we are all equally wise - and equally foolish.
9287,Albert Einstein,Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.
9288,Albert Einstein,"He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead his eyes are closed."
9289,Albert Einstein,"How strange is the lot of us mortals Each of us is here for a brief sojourn for what purpose he knows not, though he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people."
9290,Albert Einstein,"I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right."
9291,Albert Einstein,An empty stomach is not a good political advisor.
9292,Albert Einstein,In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
9293,Albert Einstein,Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized.
9294,Albert Einstein,More and more I come to value charity and love of one's fellow being above everything else... All our lauded technological progress--our very civilization--is like the axe in the hand of the pathological criminal.
9295,Albert Einstein,"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead his eyes are closed."
9296,Albert Einstein,"What is the meaning of human life, or of organic life altogether To answer this question at all implies a religion. Is there any sense then, you ask, in putting it I answer, the man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life."
9297,Albert Einstein,The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious - the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science.
9298,Albert Einstein,"I do not believe in the immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern without any superhuman authority behind it."
9299,Albert Einstein,"Any power must be an enemy of mankind which enslaves the individual by terror and force, whether it arises under the Fascist or the Communist flag. All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded to the individual."
9300,Albert Einstein,The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.
9301,Albert Einstein,Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.
9302,Albert Einstein,"...One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought."
9303,Albert Einstein,"If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor."
9304,Albert Einstein,"Why does this magnificent applied science, which saves work and makes life easier, bring us little happiness The simple answer runs because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it."
9305,Albert Einstein,"In light of knowledge attained, the happy achievement seems almost a matter of course, and any intelligent student can grasp it without too much trouble. But the years of anxious searching in the dark, with their intense longing, their alterations of confidence and exhaustion and the final emergence into the light -- only those who have experienced it can understand it."
9306,Albert Einstein,"I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts the rest are details."
9307,Albert Einstein,You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.
9308,Albert Einstein,Every kind of peaceful cooperation among men is primarily based on mutual trust and only secondarily on institutions such as courts of justice and police.
9309,Albert Einstein,"If I were to start taking care of my grooming, I would no longer be my own self ... so the hell with it ... I will continue to be unconcerned about it, which surely has the advantage that I'm left in peace by many a fop who would otherwise come to see me."
9310,Albert Einstein,I like neither new clothes nor new kinds of food.
9311,Albert Einstein,It would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it. (referring to clothing)
9312,Albert Einstein,"If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture, let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies."
9313,Albert Einstein,There is an atmosphere of well-sounding oratory that likes to attach itself to dress clothes. Away with it
9314,Albert Einstein,"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the 'Universe,' a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
9315,Albert Einstein,"If a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign"
9316,Albert Einstein,The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.
9317,Albert Einstein,There comes a time when the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but can never prove how it got there.
9318,Albert Einstein,"Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors, concern for the great unsolved problems of the organization of labor and the distribution of goods--in order that the creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations."
9319,Albert Einstein,"I believe that whoever tries to think things through honestly will soon recognize how unworthy and even fatal is the traditional bias against Negroes. What can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice He must have the courage to set an example by words and deed, and must watch lest his children become influenced by racial bias."
9320,Albert Einstein,Bias against the Negro is the worst disease from which the society of our nation suffers.
9321,Albert Einstein,The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.
9322,Albert Einstein,"I feel that you are justified in looking into the future with true assurance, because you have a mode of living in which we find the joy of life and the joy of work harmoniously combined. Added to this is the spirit of ambition which pervades your very being, and seems to make the day's work like a happy child at play. (referring to America)"
9323,Albert Einstein,A theory can be proved by experiment but no path leads from experiment to the birth of a theory.
9324,Albert Einstein,"The American lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European. Life for him is always becoming, never being."
9325,Albert Einstein,The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.
9326,Albert Einstein,"As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is inevitable."
9327,Albert Einstein,"If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it"
9328,Albert Einstein,Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
9329,Albert Einstein,"If A equals success, then the formula is A equals X plus Y plus Z. X is work. Y is play. Z is keep your mouth shut."
9330,Albert Einstein,"I am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity forward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker. The example of great and pure individuals is the only thing that can lead us to noble thoughts and deeds. Money only appeals to selfishness and irresistibly invites abuse. Can anyone imagine Moses, Jesus or Ghandi armed with the money-bags of Carnegie"
9331,Albert Einstein,Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.
9332,Albert Einstein,Gravitation can not be held responsible for people falling in love.
9333,Albert Einstein,"My religion consists of a humble admiration of the unlimitable superior who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God."
9334,Albert Einstein,"The wirless telegraph is not difficult to understand. The ordinary telegraph is like a very long cat. You pull the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angeles. The wireless is the same, only without the cat."
9335,Albert Einstein,"Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings admiring, asking and observing, there we enter the realm of Art and Science."
9336,Albert Einstein,Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are not even capable of forming such opinions.
9337,Albert Einstein,The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.
9338,Albert Einstein,"When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge."
9339,Albert Einstein,Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.
9340,Albert Einstein,"Since I do not foresee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace. Perhaps it is well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear, it would not do."
9341,Albert Einstein,Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. For this reason mastery demands all of a person.
9342,Albert Einstein,"Too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves."
9343,Albert Einstein,"Of what significance is one's one existence, one is basically unaware. What does a fish know about the water in which he swims all his life The bitter and the sweet come from outside. The hard from within, from one's own efforts. For the most part I do what my own nature drives me to do. It is embarrassing to earn such respect and love for it."
9344,Albert Einstein,The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
9345,Albert Einstein,"You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this And radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat."
9346,Albert Einstein,Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.
9347,Albert Einstein,It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.
9348,Albert Einstein,"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one."
9349,Albert Einstein,"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."
9350,Albert Einstein,There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
9351,Albert Einstein,The difference between what the most and the least learned people know is inexpressibly trivial in relation to that which is unknown.
9352,Albert Einstein,"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction."
9353,Albert Einstein,Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything one learned in school.
9354,Albert Einstein,We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us.
9355,Albert Einstein,"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community."
9356,Albert Einstein,Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.
9357,Albert Einstein,Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the Gods.
9358,Albert Einstein,"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."
9359,Albert Einstein,"Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity."
9360,Albert Einstein,Generations to come will find it difficult to believe that a man such as Gandhi ever walked the face of this earth.
9361,Albert Einstein,"Not until we dare to regard ourselves as a nation, not until we respect ourselves, can we gain the esteem of others, or rather only then will it come of its own accord."
9362,Albert Einstein,I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.
9363,Albert Einstein,Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.
9364,Albert Einstein,The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.
9365,Albert Einstein,"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death."
9366,Albert Einstein,Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.
9367,Albert Einstein,The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.
9368,Albert Einstein,God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.
9369,Albert Einstein,A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.
9370,Albert Einstein,Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.
9371,Albert Einstein,"We cannot dispair of humanity, since we are ourselves human beings."
9372,Albert Einstein,"Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical equation stands forever."
9373,Albert Einstein,No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong.
9374,Albert Einstein,Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.
9375,Albert Einstein,Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.
9376,Albert Einstein,How I wish that somewhere there existed an island for those who are wise and of goodwill In such a place even I would be an ardent patriot.
9377,Albert Einstein,"The fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears, for there's no risk of accident for someone who's dead."
9378,Albert Einstein,"The state exists for man, not man for the state. The same may be said of science. These are old phrases, coined by people who saw in human individuality the highest human value. I would hesitate to repeat them, were it not for the ever recurring danger that they may be forgotten, especially in these days of organization and stereotypes."
9379,Albert Einstein,The physicist cannot simply surrender to the philosopher the critical contemplation of the theoretical foundations for he himself knows best and feels most surely where the shoe pinches.... he must try to make clear in his own mind just how far the concepts which he uses are justified... The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.
9380,Albert Einstein,"As long as Nazi violence was unleashed only, or mainly, against the Jews, the rest of the world looked on passively and even treaties and agreements were made with the patently criminal government of the Third Reich.... The doors of Palestine were closed to Jewish immigrants, and no country could be found that would admit those forsaken people. They were left to perish like their brothers and sisters in the occupied countries. We shall never forget the heroic efforts of the small countries, of the Scandinavian, the Dutch, the Swiss nations, and of individuals in the occupied part of Europe who did all in their power to protect Jewish lives."
9381,Albert Einstein,"Since that deluge of newspaper articles I have been so flooded with questions, invitations, suggestions, that I keep dreaming I am roasting in Hell, and the mailman is the devil eternally yelling at me, showering me with more bundles of letters at my head because I have not answered the old ones."
9382,Albert Einstein,"My pacifism is an instinctive feeling, a feeling that possesses me because the murder of men is disgusting. My attitude is not derived from any intellectual theory but is based on my deepest antipathy to every kind of cruelty and hatred."
9383,Albert Einstein,"Of all the communities available to us there is not one I would want to devote myself to, except for the society of the true searchers, which has very few living members at any time."
9384,Albert Einstein,"I have become rather like King Midas, except that everything turns not into gold but into a circus."
9385,Albert Einstein,The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.
9386,Albert Einstein,"The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."
9387,Albert Einstein,The only real valuable thing is intuition.
9388,Albert Einstein,The point is to develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide the child over to important fields for society. Such a school demands from the teacher that he be a kind of artist in his province.
9389,Albert Einstein,"In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep."
9390,Albert Einstein,"The Lord God is subtle, but malicious He is not."
9391,Albert Einstein,The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unhappy but hardly fit for life.
9392,Albert Einstein,"It is not the fruits of scientific research that elevate man and enrich his nature. but the urge to understand, the intellectual work, creative or receptive."
9393,Albert Einstein,"The crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a perparation for his future career."
9394,Albert Einstein,"Do not worry about your problems in mathematics. I assure you, my problems with mathematics are much greater than yours."
9395,Albert Einstein,The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.
9396,Albert Einstein,"Relativity applies to physics, not ethics."

10919,Paxton Blair,A grownup is a child with layers on.
10920,Paxton Blair,There has been in recent years excessive emphasis on a citizen's rights and inadequate stress put upon his duties and responsibilities.

10922,Toledo Blade,A great many open minds should be closed for repairs.
10923,Baron Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett,"People who've had happy childhoods are wonderful, but they're bland... An unhappy childhood compels you to use your imagination to create a world in which you can be happy. Use your old grief. That's the gift you're given."

10934,Rachel Blanchard,"The child gets two confusing messages when a parent tells him which is the right fork to use, and then proceeds to use the wrong one. So does the child who listens to parents bicker and fuss, yet is told to be nice to his brothers and sisters."
10935,Rachel Blanchard,I think it's more important to be fit so that you can be healthy and enjoy activities than it is to have a good body.

10947,H Hahn Blavatsky,"When he has ceased to hear the many, he may discern the One - the inner sound which kills the outer."

10950,H Hahn Blavatsky,"After 3, a body has a mind of its own."

10960,Henry C. Blinn,Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.

10967,Srully D. Blotnick,What looks like a loss may be the very event which is subsequently responsible for helping to produce the major achievement of your life.
10968,Srully D. Blotnick,The fact remains that the overwhelming majority of people who have become wealthy have become so thanks to work they found profoundly absorbing. The long term study of people who eventually became wealthy clearly reveals that their 'luck' arose from accidental dedication they had to an arena they enjoyed.
10969,Milo Bloom,The first sign of a nervous breakdown is when you start thinking your work is terribly important.
10970,John Blofeld,"If being wealthy is taken to mean having the means to satisfy one's every want, all but the very poor can become rich as thou at a single stroke of a magician's wand, simply by ceasing to want more than is really necessary for sustaining life.

10971,Barbara Bloom,"You have to choose where you look, and in making that choice you eliminate entire worlds."

10976,Harold Bloom,"I realized early on that the academy and the literary world alike-and I don't think there really is a distinction between the two-are always dominated by fools, knaves, charlatans and bureaucrats. And that being the case, any human being, male or female, of whatever status, who has a voice of her or his own, is not going to be liked."

11006,Derek Curtis Bok,"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance."

11008,Bokonon,"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before. He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way."

11020,Erma Bombeck,"There are people who put their dreams in a little box and say, 'Yes, I've got dreams, of course I've got dreams.' Then they put the box away and bring it out once in awhile to look in it, and yep, they're still there. These are great dreams, but they never even get out of the box. It takes an uncommon amount of guts to put your dreams on the line, to hold them up and say, 'How good or how bad am I' That's where courage comes in."

We have our attache' cases and our three piece suits. I get very disgusted with the younger generation of women. We had a torch to pass, and they are just sitting there. They don't realize it can be taken away. Things are going to have to get worse before they join in fighting the battle."
11029,Erma Bombeck,It is fast approaching the point where I don't want to elect anyone stupid enough to want the job.

11032,Erma Bombeck,Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.
11033,Erma Bombeck,... it's simply wrong to always order kids to stop that fighting. There are times when one child is simply defending his rights and damned well should be fighting.

11141,Elizabeth Bowen,No object is mysterious. The mystery is in your eye.
11142,Elizabeth Bowen,"The heart may think it knows better the senses know that absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends. The friend becomes a traitor by breaking, however unwillingly or sadly, out of our own zone a hard judgment is passed on him, for all the pleas of the heart."

11173,Hal,Does Grandpa love to baby-sit his grandchildren Are you kidding By day he is too busy taking hormone shots at the doctor's or chip shots on the golf course. At night he and Grandma are too busy doing the cha-cha.
11174,Hal,"Whatever happened to that old-fashioned Grandpa If he still survives, he must be hiding in the small towns. You sure don't see him very often in the big city. The big-city Grandpa has gone big time. ... He is the life of every party, and out to prove he is just as young as he ever was. A grandchild who makes the mistake of calling him 'Gramps' is lucky if he isn't rewarded by a quick kick in the stomach."

11292,Joyce,Studies indicate that the one quality all successful people have is persistence.

11555,John Calvin,"For Scripture is the school of the Holy Spirit, in which, as nothing is omitted that is both necessary and useful to know, so nothing is taught but what is expedient to know. Therefore we must guard against depriving believers of anything disclosed about predestination in Scripture, lest we seem either wickedly to defraud them of the blessing of their God or to accuse and scoff at the Holy Spirit for having published what it is in any way profitable to suppress."
11556,John Calvin,"The sum is, that the worship of God must be spiritual, in order that it may correspond with His nature.

11559,John Calvin,"The Fanaticism which discards the Scripture, under the pretense of resorting to immediate revelations is subversive of every principle of Christianity.

11560,John Calvin,"Without Christ, sciences in every department are vain....The man who knows not God is vain, though he should be conversant with every branch of learning. Nay more, we may affirm this too with truth, that these choice gifts of God -- expertness of mind, acuteness of judgment, liberal sciences, and acquaintance with languages, are in a manner profaned in every instance in which they fall to the lot of wicked men."

11564,Joseph Campbell,"Eternity has nothing to do with the hereafter... This is it... If you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere. The experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life. Heaven is not the place to have the experience here's the place to have the experience."
11565,Joseph Campbell,Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.

11572,Colin Campbell,"Indeed, the Founders mentioned the pagan authors in so many heartfelt speeches, pamphlets and letters that today's sweeping references to America's 'Christian' roots and 'Judeo-Christian heritage' ought to be amended. Maybe these terms should be reserved to explain the traditional religions and morality of individuals, families, congregations, small communitities. Politically, our notions of virtue and vice have had another genesis."
11573,Joan B. Campbell,"Jesus' ministry was clearly defined, and the alternatives to the illusion and temptations of the desert were spelled out. A choice was made--life abundant, full, and free for all. Make no mistake about it, the day that choice was made, Jesus became suspect. That day in the temple he sealed the fate already prepared for him. How was the world to understand one who rejected an offer of power and control"

11580,Frank Caplan,Play has been man's most useful preoccupation.
11581,Andrea Canaan,"It's as if we think liberation a fixed quantity, that there is only so much to go around. That an individual or community is liberated at the expense of another When we view liberation as a scarce resource, something only a precious few of us can have, we stifle our potential, our creativity, our genius for living, learning and growing."
11582,Elias Canetti,"Adults find pleasure in deceiving a child. They consider it necessary, but they also enjoy it. The children very quickly figure it out and then practice deception themselves."
11583,Elias Canetti,"The self-explorer, whether he wants to or not, becomes the explorer of everything else. He learns to see himself, but suddenly, provided he was honest, all the rest appears, and it is as rich as he was, and, as a final crowning, richer."

11620,George,There's a moment coming. It's not here yet. It's still on the way. It's in the future. It hasn't arrived. Here it comes. Here it is  It's gone.
11621,George,"Wouldn't it be weird if the only way people could die was that their heads suddenly exploded without warning If there was simply no other cause of death One day you'd be sitting there having a hot chocolate, and suddenly your head would explode."

This is unpleasant for every man. Consequently every man does everything possible to postpone the date, and would sacrifice anything that he has if he could reverse the sentence. Practically all religions and all philosophies have started thus crudely, by promising their adherents some such reward as immortality. No religion has failed hitherto by not promising enough the present breaking up of all religions is due to the fact that people have asked to see the securities. Men have even renounced the important material advantages which a well-organized religion may confer upon a State, rather than acquiesce in fraud or falsehood, or even in any system which, if not proved guilty, is at least unable to demonstrate its innocence. Being more or less bankrupt, the best thing that we can do is to attack the problem afresh without preconceived ideas. Let us begin by doubting every statement. Let us find a way of subjecting every statement to the test of experiment. Is there any truth at all in the claims of various religions Let us examine the question."

But in the end, some lack in their moral fiber, some gnawing, nibbling fear held them back. They never started. They stayed where they were. They dropped back. They failed somehow to release within themselves that power which lies in every individual, and is released only when he starts forward in a straight line for the object about which he has dreamed. The man who never starts, never feels that sense of power."

13363,William Golding,"Among the virtues and vices that make up the British character, we have one vice, at least, that Americans ought to view with sympathy.

13398,Lavina Goodell,"Critics are by no means the end of the law. Do not think all is over with you because you articles are rejected. It may be that the editor has his drawer full, or that he does not know enough to appreciate you, or you have not gained a reputation, or he is not in a mood to be pleased. A critic's judgment is like that of any intelligent person. If he has experience, he is capable of judging whether a book will sell. That is all."

13430,John B. Gough,If you want to succeed in the world you must make your own opportunities as you go on. The man who waits for some seventh wave to toss him on dry land will find that the seventh wave is a long time a-coming. You can commit no greater folly than to sit by the road side until someone comes along and invites you to ride with him to wealth or influence.
13431,John B. Gough,"What is a minority The chosen heroes of this earth have been in a minority. There is not a social, political, or religious privilege that you enjoy today that was not bought for you by the blood and tears and patient suffering of the minority.

13449,Antonio Gramsci,"In the life of children there are two very clear-cut phases, before and after puberty. Before puberty the child's personality has not yet formed and it is easier to guide its life and make it acquire specific habits of order, discipline, and work after puberty the personality develops impetuously and all extraneous intervention becomes odious, tyrannical, insufferable. Now it so happens that parents feel the responsibility towards their children precisely during this second period, when it is too late then of course the stick and violence enter the scene and yield very few results indeed. Why not instead take an interest in the child during the first period"
13450,Antonio Gramsci,"If you think about it seriously, all the questions about the soul and the immortality of the soul and paradise and hell are at bottom only a way of seeing this very simple fact that every action of ours is passed on to others according to its value, of good or evil, it passes from father to son, from one generation to the next, in a perpetual movement."
13451,William Franklin Billy Graham,The most eloquent prayer is the prayer through hands that heal and bless. The highest form of worship is the worship of unselfish Christian service. The greatest form of praise is the sound of consecrated feet seeking out the lost and helpless.

13501,Colin Greenwood,"It is suggested that, in domestic violence at least, the presence or absence of a firearm, or of any other type of weapon, is of far less importance to the outcome than the passion generated in the attacker. The man who has lost control will cause serious injuries in many cases, quite irrespective of the weapon he uses and regardless of the certainty of detection and punishment."
13502,Colin Greenwood,In none of the cases examined in this study was the existence of these gun registration records of any assistance in detecting a crime and no one questioned during the course of this study could offer any evidence to establish the value of the system of registering weapons.
13503,Colin Greenwood,"No matter how one approaches the figures, one is forced to the rather startling conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much less when there were no controls of any sort and when anyone, convicted criminal or lunatic, could buy any type of firearm without restriction. Half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended, perversely, with a far greater use of this weapon in crime than ever before."

13522,Paul Gruchow,"It is one thing to decry the rat race...that is the good and honorable work of moralists. It is quite another thing to quit the rat race, to drop out, to refuse to run any further--that is the work of the individualist. It is offensive because it is impolite it makes the rebuke personal the individualist calls not his or her behavior into question, but mine."

13524,Philip Guedalla,Autobiography is an unrivaled vehicle for telling the truth about other people.

13526,Henry Anatole Grunwald,"Nagging questions remain Where is the line between making the most of one's potential and reaching for the unattainable Where is the line between education as a tool and education as a kind of magic The line is blurred and that is why when education fails, disillusionment is so bitter."

13529,Edgar Albert Guest,"The timid and fearful first failures dismay, but the stout heart stays trying by night and by day. He values his failures as lessons that teach The one way to get to the goal he would reach."
13530,Edgar Albert Guest,"I'd like to be the sort of friend that you have been to me, I'd like to be the help that you've been always glad to be I'd like to mean as much to you each minute of the day, as you have meant, old friend of mine, to me along the way."

13716,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If any man says he hates war more than I do, he better have a knife, that's all I have to say."
13717,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you go through a lot of hammers each month, I don't think it necessarily means you're a hard worker. It may just mean that you have a lot to learn about proper hammer maintenance."
13718,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I bet one legend that keeps recurring throughout history, in every culture, is the story of Popeye."
13719,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If someone told me it wasn't 'fashionable' to talk about freedom, I think I'd just have to look him square in the eye and say, 'Okay, YOU TELL ME what's fashionable'.' But he won't. And you know why Because you can't ask someone what's fashionable in a smart-alecky way like that. You have to be friendly and say, 'By the way, what's fashionable'"
13720,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Here's a good gag if you go swimming in a swamp and when you come out you're all covered with leeches. Just say, 'Hey, has anybody seen my raisins' (Because leeches kind of look like big raisins.)"
13721,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the same time, unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in between, plus some things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing.' This is truth, to me."
13722,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"A good way to keep a mob of peasants from killing your monster is when they break into your castle, make them be real quiet, then open a door and there's the monster, sound asleep."
13723,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Isn't it funny how we'll look out the window at the moon, and then we notice it's not the moon but a streetlight Also what's funny is how we do this every night."
13724,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Too bad you can't just grab a tree by the very tip-top and bend it clear over the ground and then let her fly, because I bet you'd be amazed at all the stuff that comes flying out."
13725,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"It seemed to me that, somehow, the blue jay was trying to communicate with me. I would see him fly into the house across the way, pick up the telephone, and dial. My phone would ring, and it would be him, but it was just this squawking and cheeping. 'What What' I would yell back, but he never did speak English."
13726,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"There should be a detective show called 'Johnny Monkey,' because every week you could have a guy say 'I ain't gonna get caught by no MONKEY,' but then he would, and I don't think I'd ever get tired of that."
13727,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff."
13728,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your act, I don't think it's a good idea to also dress the dog up like a clown, because people see that and they think, 'Forgive me, but that's just too much.'"
13729,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I think a cute movie idea would be about a parrot who is raised by eagles. It would be cute because the parrot can't seem to act like an eagle. After a while, though, to keep the movie from getting boring, maybe put in some pornography. Later, we see the happy parrot flying along, acting like an eagle. He see two parrots below and starts to attack, but it's his parents. Then, some more pornography."
13730,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Today I accidentally stepped on a snail on the sidewalk in front of our house. And I thought, I too am like that snail. I build a defensive wall around myself, a 'shell' if you will. But my shell isn't made out of a hard, protective substance. Mine is made out of tinfoil and paper bags."
13731,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"My new millionaire idea is one regular shoe and one 'swollen' shoe, for when you get bit by a rattlesnake."
13732,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I think somebody should come up with a way to breed a very large shrimp. That way, you could ride him, then after you camped at night, you could eat him. How about it, science"
13733,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,I wish everybody would have to have an electric thing implanted in our heads that gave us a shock whenever we did something to disobey the president. Then somehow I get myself elected president.
13734,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny."
13735,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I remember when I was in the army, we had the toughest drill sergeant in the world. He'd get right up next to your face and yell, and if you didn't have the right answers, mister, you'd be peeling potatoes or changing the latrine. Hey, wait. I wasn't in the army. Then who WAS that guy"
13736,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I bet the sparrow looks at the parrot and thinks, yes, you can talk, but LISTEN TO YOURSELF"
13737,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you're ever selling your house, and some people come by, and a big rat comes out and he's dragging the rattrap because it didn't quite kill him, just tell the people he's your pet and that's a trick you taught him."
13738,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I think there probably should be a rule that if you're talking about how many loaves of bread a bullet will go through, it's understood that you mean lengthwise loaves. Otherwise, it makes no sense."
13739,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, 'If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky.' Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh."
13740,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, 'Dust to dust,' some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, 'I'll be waiting for you in heaven---with a gun.'"
13741,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,I don't think I'm ever more 'aware' than I am right after I hit my thumb with a hammer.
13742,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Worship the potato The idea seemed silly to me. But then I thought, what else is more deserving of worship It's simple, it comes from the earth, and it can kill you if you disobey it."
13743,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we BUILD to that."
13744,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little trick to calm myself down. I'll go over to the person's house and ring the doorbell. When the person comes to the door, I'm gone, but you know what I've left on the porch A jack-o'-lantern with a knife in the side of its head with a note that says 'You.' After that, I usually feel a lot better, and no harm done."
13745,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,Happiness is not a circus clown rolling around in a big tractor tire so that his arms and legs form 'spokes.' Happiness is when he stops.
13746,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you're traveling in a time machine, and you're eating corn on the cob, I don't think it's going to affect things one way or the other. But here's the point I'm trying to make Corn on the cob is good, isn't it."
13747,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car---I forget what kind it was---and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called 'Dad.' We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you."
13748,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to the old board of his. Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, 'Tadpoles Tadpoles is a winner' We all thought he was crazy. But then, we had some growing up to do."
13749,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled urination should automatically disqualify you."

13754,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Instead of trying to build newer and bigger weapons of destruction, mankind should be thinking about getting more use out of the weapons we already have."

13758,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"You can't tell me that cowboys, when they're branding cattle, don't sort of 'accidentally' brand each other every once in a while. It's their way of letting off stress."
13759,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I wish scientists would come up with a way to make dogs a lot bigger, but with a smaller head. That way, they'd still be good as watchdogs, but they wouldn't eat so much."
13760,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If I lived back in the Wild West days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like, 'Hey look. He's carrying a soldering iron' and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, 'That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice.' Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink."
13761,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Many people never stop to realize that a tree is a living thing, not that different from a tall, leafy dog that has roots and is very quiet."
13762,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you You'd be wrong though. It's Hambone."
13763,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"To us, it might look like just a rag. But to the brave, embattled men of the fort, it was more than that. It was a flag of surrender. And after that, it was torn up and used for shoe-shine rags, so the men would look nice for the surrender."
13764,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you ever go temporarily insane, don't shoot somebody, like a lot of people do. Instead, try to get some weeding done, because you'd really be surprised."

13766,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If I was a father in a waiting room, and the nurse came out and said, 'Congratulations, it's a girl,' I think a good gag would be to get real mad and yell, 'A girl You must have me mixed up with THAT dork' and point to another father."
13767,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"When you die, if you go somewhere where they ask you a bunch of questions about your life and what you learned and all, I think a good way to get out of it is just to say, 'No speaka English.'"
13768,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you were a gladiator in olden days, I bet the inefficiency of how the gladiator fights were organized and scheduled would just drive you up a wall."
13769,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I wish I could shrink down to the size of an ant. And maybe there would be thousands of other people shrunken down to ant-size, and we would get together and dig tunnels down into the ground and live there. But don't ever call us 'ants,' because we hate that."
13770,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you work on a lobster boat, sneaking up behind someone and pinching him is probably a joke that gets old real fast."
13771,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Laurie got offended that I used the word 'puke.' But to me, that's what her dinner tasted like."

13775,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I hope they never find out that lightning has a lot of vitamins in it, because do you hide from it or not"
13776,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I think when you go on trial they should have a parrot there that says guilty or not guilty for you, as a sort of courtesy."
13777,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk about freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered they were not Indians at all, but dirty clothes hampers."
13778,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"The wise man can pick up a grain of sand and envision a whole universe. But the stupid man will just lie down on some seaweed and roll around until he's completely draped in it. Then he'll stand up and go, 'Hey, I'm Vine Man.'"
13779,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If I come back as a horsefly, I think my favorite thing would be to land on someone's lip. Even if they smash you, ick, you're all over their lip"
13780,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"If you had a school for professional fireworks people, I don't think you could cover fuses in just one class. It's just too rich a subject."
13781,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Basically, there are three ways the skunk and I are a lot alike. The first is, we both like to spread our 'stink' around. The second is we both get hit by cars a lot. The third is stripes."
13782,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Here's a good tip for when you go to the beach A sand dollar may look like a nice cracker that someone left, but trust me, they don't taste like it."
13783,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I think a good scene in a movie would be where one scientist tells another scientist, 'You know what will save the world You're holding it in your hand.' And the other scientist looks, and in his hand are peanuts. Then when he looks up, the first scientist is being taken away to the insane asylum."
13784,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"As we were driving, we saw a sign that said 'Watch For Rocks.' Marta said it should read 'Watch For PRETTY Rocks.' I told her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department, but she started saying it was a joke---just to get out of writing a simple letter And I thought I was lazy"
13785,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself. Mankind. Basically, it's made up of two separate words---'mank' and 'ind'. What do these words mean It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind."

13792,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"When you go to a party at somebody's house, don't automatically assume that the drinks are free. Ask, and ask often."

Oh, my mistake."

13853,Jack Handey Deep Thoughts,"I wish I lived back in the Old West days, because I'd save up my money for about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick.

14007,David Havard,"Most of us have been taught about the need to appropriate by faith what is already ours through grace. We all desire to have more joy in our Christian life. The keys to experiencing joy are available to all of us. We need to understand the gospel of the grace of God as revealed to the Apostle Paul. Then as we put Paul's instructions into practice, we will come to know God experientially. This will cause us to know Him better which will cause us to want to obey more, and on and on it goes. Then as we learn and obey God and become focused on spiritual things instead of earthly things, we will become thankful for everything that God has provided for us in Christ. Knowledge, obedience, and thankfulness will then lead to abundant joy in our everyday life In the words of the old hymn Trust and obey, For there's no other way, To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey."

14015,Stephen William Hawking,"A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said 'What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.'

Once separated from the body, and after the struggle to acquire piety, which consists in knowing God and injuring none, such a soul becomes all intelligence. The impious soul, however, punishes itself by seeking a human body to enter into, for no other body can receive a human soul it cannot enter the body of an animal devoid of reason. Divine law preserves the human soul from such infamy. . .The soul passeth from form to form and the mansions of her pilgrimage are manifold. Thou puttest off thy bodies as raiment and as vesture dost thou fold them up. Thou art from old, O Soul of Man yea, thou art from everlasting."

It is also rare, for it requires uncommon humility, tolerance, and wisdom."
14229,Dee W. Hock,"We are at that very point in time when a 400-year-old age is dying and another is struggling to be born - a shifting of culture, science, society and institutions enormously greater than the world has ever experienced.

14246,Lisa Hoffman,"Love is like pi - natural, irrational, and very important."
14247,James P. Hogan,"Scientists are the easiest to fool. They think in straight, predictable, directable, and therefore misdirectable, lines.

Scientists are no problem against them I feel quite confident."

14398,Ibycus,"Contests allow no excuses, no more do friendships."
14399,Eric Idle,"At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humour it is clearly of value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are claiming special privileges which should not be granted."

14429,Paul Ingram,"A moment's thought shows that man's feeling of isolation has no foundation, biologically or sociologically. We grow out of the Universe, we are an expression of it. The iron in our blood comes from the high temperature fusion of stars. We constantly interact with our environment. The force of gravity keeps our feet upon the earth and has a vital effect upon our metabolism. The air we breathe comes form the seas and the leaves, and the sun allows the process to take place.

14495,Kaleel Jamison,"Relationships--of all kinds--are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that.

14508,Amy Hillyard Jensen,"Get rid of imagined guilt. You did the best you could at the time, all things considered. If you made mistakes, learn to accept that we are all imperfect.

15110,Aldo Leopold,"Like winds and sunsets, wild things were taken for granted until progress began to do away with them.

For us of the minority, the opportunity to see geese is more important that television."
15111,Aldo Leopold,"A thing is right if it tends to preserve the stability, integrity, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong if it tends otherwise."
15112,Giacomo Leopardi,"Real misanthropes are not found in solitude, but in the real world since it is experience of life, and not philosophy, which produces real hatred of mankind."

15121,Doris Lessing,"Think wrongly if you please, but in all cases think for yourself."
15122,Doris Lessing,"You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accomodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others, will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself-educating your own judgement. Those that stay must remember, always and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this society."

Arthur Lewis,"Do you ever sit down and wonder what is wrong with the world Do you ever ask yourself why it is that Christians seem to have so little influence, why they seem to achieve so little, for all their numbers, in putting the world right To each of those two questions there is ultimately but one answer.

15196,"Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.","If I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes."
15197,"Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.","To a person in love, the value of the individual is intuitively known. Love needs no logic for its mission."
15198,"Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.","It was a love of the air and sky and flying, the lure of adventure, the appreciation of beauty. It lay beyond the descriptive words of men-where immortality is touched through danger, where life meets death on equal plane where man is more than man, and existence both supreme and valueless at the same time."

15239,Jack London,"I would rather be ashes than dust I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."
15240,Jack London,"A bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog."
15241,Jack London,"There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive."

15245,Haniel Long,"In youth the human body drew me and was the object of my secret and natural dreams. But body after body has taken away from me that sensual phosphorescence which my youth delighted in. Within me is no disturbing interplay now, but only the steady currents of adaptation and of sympathy."

15291,Eric Lustbader,"Men make the mistake of thinking that because women can't see the sense in violence, they must be passive creatures. It's just not true. In one important way, at least, men are the passive sex. Given a choice, they will always opt for the status quo. They hate change of any kind, and they fight against it constantly. On the other hand, what women want is stability, which when you stop to think about it is a very different animal."

15293,Martin Luther,"Christ is the Master the Scriptures are only the servant. The true way to test all the Books is to see whether they work the will of Christ or not.

15325,Lucretius,"What came from the earth returns back to the earth, and the spirit that was sent from heaven, again carried back, is received into the temple of heaven."
15326,Lucretius,"Pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another's great tribulation not because any man's troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive you are free of them yourself is pleasant."

15342,Lord Macaulay,"Many politicians lay it down as a self-evident proposition, that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom. The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim."

15360,Archibald MacLeish,"It is not in the world of ideas that life is lived. Life is lived for better or worse in life, and to a man in life, his life can be no more absurd than it can be the opposite of absurd, whatever that opposite may be."

15382,Sidney Madwed,"The finest gift you can give anyone is encoragement. Yet, almost no one gets the encouragement they need to grow to their full potential.

15468,Arthur Marx,"So. The time has come for me to get my kite flying, stretch out in the sun, kick off my shoes, and speak my piece. 'The days of struggle are over,' I should be able to say. 'I can look back now and tell myself I don't have a single regret.' But I do. Many years ago a very wise man named Bernard Baruch took me aside and put his arm around my shoulder. 'Harpo, my boy,' he said, 'I'm going to give you three pieces of advice, three things you should always remember.' My heart jumped and I glowed with expectation. I was going to hear the magic password to a rich, full life from the master himself. 'Yes, sir' I said. And he told me the three things. I regret that I've forgotten what they were."

15492,Jackie Mason,"I have enough money to last me the rest of my life, unless I buy something."
15493,Richard M. Mathews,You are right on target when you say that mad scientists have a total disregard for the wellbeing of others. We don't want to spread evil we just see no point in bothering to spread good.
15494,"Charles Mathias, Jr.","I cannot help but wonder whether, by continuing and expanding the school lunch program, we aren't witnessing, if not encouraging, the slow demise of yet another American tradition the brown bag. ... Perhaps we are beholding yet another break in the chain that links child to home."
15495,"Charles Mathias, Jr.","The brown bag, of course, had its imperfections. While some kids carried roast beef sandwiches, others had peanut butter. I have no way of knowing if all of those brown bags contained 'nutritionally adequate diets.' But I do know that those brown bags and those lunch pails symbolized parental love and responsibility."
15496,James L. Mathews,"It's not the rules and regulations you follow carefully that will win you favor with God but rather offering your life to Him in complete faith that His Son, Jesus Christ, conquered sin and death on your behalf and for your salvation."

15498,Edgar Lee Masters,"Genius is a bend in the creek where bright water has gathered, and which mirrors the trees, the sky and the banks. It just does that because it is there and the scenery is there. Talent is a fine mirror with a silver frame, with the name of the owner engraved on the back."
15499,Michael Masukawa,"Ignorance, apathy, and lethargy cause the most problems in our world. People don't know what's going on, they don't care, and they're too lazy to find out."
15500,Michael Masukawa,"There are still normal people around, they just changed the definition of normal"
15501,William R. Matthews,"Naturally, we cannot say much about the spiritual body, because we cannot imagine what it would be like to have a spiritual body different from that which we now inhabit but it seems to me reasonable to believe that we are weaving our spiritual bodies as we go along."
15502,"William R. Mattox, Jr.","'True love' isn't so much a dreamy feeling that you have as it is an enduring commitment to give sacrificially --even, or perhaps especially, when you don't feel like it."

15530,Anne McCaffrey,Make no judgements where you have no compassion.
15531,Forest McDonald,"Americans who had traveled in Europe knew the 'free' European peasants suffered considerably greater oppression and misery than did American bondsman. Modern scholarship has shown that the exploitation rate -- the percentage of the worker's production that was taken from him by his owners -- was lower among the slaves than among European peasants, that work loads were light, and that slaves actually experienced a considerable measure of personal freedom."

15540,Mark McGee,"What should we emphasize in our teaching We learn much from Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus. Paul mentored each and sent them out to the churches to encourage and instruct God's Children of Grace. Notice how often Paul uses the words 'command,' 'warn,' and 'remind' in his letters to Timothy and Titus. God wants us to be loving and gentle in the way we teach His children, but He also wants us to be strong, precise and decisive in what we declare. We are not 'asking' Christians to obey God's Word. We are 'telling' them what God commands. We have no special power in ourselves, but when we preach God's Word we have the 'Power' of God behind us Our preaching and teaching should be in the 'Power and Strength' of God. He gave us the responsibility and authority to declare His Word. We do it humbly, but we do it."
15541,Mark McGee,"Paul's evangelistic mission was different from the Kingdom Apostles, but in many ways the same. The Kingdom Apostles preached Jesus the Messiah, ready to return to Israel and set up His Messianic Kingdom. From Israel, the Apostles, with Christ on David's Throne, were to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe everything Christ had commanded them. They would do that because all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to Christ. As we all know, that did not happen. It will happen in the future, but it has not yet happened. What has happened is that Christ revealed a Mystery through His Special Apostle Paul."
15542,Mark McGee,"God loves the world. That's plain to see as we read His Word. Today, God loves the world through us, His Children of Grace. Christ is 'in' us and we are 'in' Christ. Christ is loving people and reaching out to them through us. He is making His appeal through us. He is reconciling people to Himself through us"
15543,Mark McGee,"We were lost and dead in sin. We were by nature objects of God's wrath. But God Loved us That Love caused Him to do something about our situation. God is rich in mercy, so He made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions. God acted on His Love for us and saved us by His Grace Grace is the result of the actions of His Love. The remarkable thing about His Grace is that He didn't ask us to do anything but believe Him. God didn't ask us to perform some great deed. He didn't demand obedience from us before He would save us. God made us alive with Christ 'even when we were dead in transgressions and sins.' God is showing the universe 'the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.' (Ephesians 27) God was Kind to us 'in' Christ because He Loved us."

15547,George Stanley McGovern,The whole campaign was a tragic case of mistaken identity.
15548,George Stanley McGovern,"To those who charge that liberalism has been tried and found wanting, I answer that the failure is not in the idea, but in the course of recent history. The New Deal was ended by World War II. The New Frontier was closed by Berlin and Cuba almost before it was opened. And the Great Society lost its greatness in the jungles of Indochina."
15549,George Stanley McGovern,"When people ask if the United States can afford to place on trial the president, if the system can stand impeachment, my answer is, Can we stand anything else"

15553,Phyllis Mcginley,"To be a housewife is ... a difficult, a wrenching, sometimes an ungrateful job if it is looked on only as a job. Regarded as a profession, it is the noblest as it is the most ancient of the catalogue. Let none persuade us differently or the world is lost indeed."
15554,Phyllis Mcginley,"God knows that a mother needs fortitude and courage and tolerance and flexibility and patience and firmness and nearly every other brave aspect of the human soul. But because I happen to be a parent of almost fiercely maternal nature, I praise casualness . It seems to me the rarest of virtues. It is useful enough when children are small. It is important to the point of necessity when they are adolescents."
15555,Phyllis Mcginley,A hobby a day keeps the doldrums away.

15563,Dennis McKinsey,"If God kills, lies, cheats, discriminates, and otherwise behaves in a manner that puts the Mafia to shame, that's Okay, he's God. He can do whatever he wants. Anyone who adheres to this philosophy has had his sense of morality, decency, justice and humaneness warped beyond recognition by the very book that is supposedly preaching the opposite."
15564,Mike McLaren,"Never give up. If you want to be something, be conceited about it, give yourself a chance. Never say you are not good, that will never get you anywhere. Set goals, That's what life is made of."
15565,Millicent Carey McIntosh,"There is no greater excitement than to support an intellectual wife and have her support you. Marriage is a partnership in which each inspires the other, and brings fruition to both of you."
15566,Millicent Carey McIntosh,The most important phase of living with a person is respect for that person as an individual.

15583,Peter McWilliams,"The more severe the pain or illness, the more severe will be the necessary changes. These may involve breaking bad habits, or acquiring some new and better ones."
15584,Peter McWilliams,"Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories We would be more alive if we did more of this, and, Life would be more lovely if we did less of that. Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away."

15586,Peter McWilliams,"Acceptance is such an important commodity, some have called it the first law of personal growth."
15587,Peter McWilliams,"Acceptance is not a state of passivity or inaction. I am not saying you can't change the world, right wrongs, or replace evil with good. Acceptance is, in fact, the first step to successful action. If you don't fully accept a situation precisely the way it is, you will have difficulty changing it. Moreover, if you don't fully accept the situation, you will never really know if the situation should be changed."
15588,Peter McWilliams,Resentment is anger directed at others--at what they did or did not do.

It tells you that the forces that affirm life are stronger than those that negate it.

16937,Larry Riemersma,"As a sinner I could not please God, I could not neutralize or pay for my own sin. But when God justified me by His grace He went on record declaring me righteous. He didn't wave a magic wand and declare me to be innocent. His holiness would not permit it. A basis for declaring me righteous was needed.

Loving your enemy is manifest in putting your arms not around the man but around the social situation, to take power from those who misuse it--at which point they can become human too."

17223,Paul Sadler,"As we study the Word of God rightly divided we are to understand that God has arranged His dealings with mankind into two programs. We have His prophesied purpose and His secret purpose. Prophecy has to do with the earth and Christ's reign upon it during the millennial kingdom, while the Mystery concerns our exaltation with Christ in the heavenlies."
17224,Paul Sadler,"Why Paul God already had called twelve apostles of the kingdom Although Judas had fallen in transgression, the seat of his apostolic office was filled by Matthias preceding the day of Pentecost. Insofar as Paul was unconverted at the time, he could not have possibly fulfilled the qualificatios set down by the Holy Spirit to be numbered with the twelve (Acts 121-26). Of course, there are many dispensationalists who would agree with this interpretation, but teach that God ordained Paul to be the thirteenth apostle of the kingdom. Perhaps you have heard the saying, 'They jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.' In other words, we have gone from bad to worse, which is certainly the case with this view. the number twelve is stamped throughout the pages of prophecy, thus eliminating the possibility of a thirteenth apostolic office (Matt. 1928 cf. Rev. 12-21). What logical explanation then can we give for Paul's apostleship Before the foundation of the world, God foreordained that He would raise up a new apostle to reveal His eternal purpose for the parenthetical age of Grace in which we now live. Hence, Paul says 'But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen Gentiles...' (Gal. 115.16). When God temporarily rolled up the building plans of prophecy and placed them aside, He made known a secret set of plans. With this program came a completely new set of blueprints. According to the counsel of His will, He had predetermined to call Paul as the masterbuilder of the project. So then, the instructions for our building program are found in Paul's epistles. Little wonder the apostles says 'I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.' (1 Cor. 310). It is essential to use Pauline constructio materials (grace doctrines), simply because someday soon the Building Inspector will examine our workmanship to determine if we followed His codes."
17225,Paul Sadler,"It has been said that God's gift is also indescribable because of the grace by which it is given. God, who is rich in mercy, gave the world the gift of His dear Son while we were at enmity with Him. Paul says 'But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us' (Rom. 58). Therefore, in Him we are freely given all things redemption, forgiveness of sins, righteousness, peace, hope, wisdom and knowledge."
17226,Paul Sadler,"When God temporarily rolled up the building plans of prophecy and placed them aside, He made known a secret set of plans. With this program came a completely new set of blueprints.

It is essential to use Pauline construction materials (grace doctrines), simply because someday soon the Building Inspector will examine our workmanship to determine if we followed His codes."
17227,Paul Sadler,"As members of the Body of Christ, each of us have been endowed with a special measure of grace to use in His service. Paul develops this theme in Romans where he states 'For as we have many members in one Body, and all members have not the same office So we, being many, are one Body in Christ, and ever one members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether...ministry, let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth, on teaching Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth, with diligence he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness."

'What will you do, Bertie, if it turns out you're wrong' she asked. 'I mean, what if--uh--when the time comes, you should meet Him What will you say' Russell was delighted with the question.

17501,Solomon Short,"Nature abhors a hero. For one thing, he violates the law of conservation of energy. For another, how can it be the survival of the fittest when the fittest keeps putting himself in situations where he is most likely to be creamed"
17502,Solomon Short,"Any great truth can -- and eventually will -- be expressed as a cliche -- a cliche is a sure and certain way to dilute an idea. For instance, my grandmother used to say, 'The black cat is always the last one off the fence.' I have no idea what she meant, but at one time, it was undoubtedly true."
17503,Solomon Short,I'm all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools. Let's start with typewriters.

17506,David M. Shoup,"The galleries are full of critics. They play no ball, they fight no fights. They make no mistakes because they attempt nothing. Down in the arena are the doers. They make mistakes because they try many things. The man who makes no mistakes lacks boldness and the spirit of adventure. He is the one who never tries anything. His is the brake on the wheel of progress. And yet it cannot be truly said he makes no mistakes, because his biggest mistake is the very fact that he tries nothing, does nothing, except criticize those who do things."

17522,Alan Simpson,The word liberal  distinguishes whatever nourishes the mind and spirit from the training which is merely practical or professional or from the trivialities which are no training at all.
17523,Alan Simpson,"A society like ours, which professes no one religion and has allowed all religions to decay, which indulges freedom to the point of license and individualism to the point of anarchy, needs all the support that responsible, cultivated homes can furnish. I hope your generation will provide a firmer shelter for civilized standards."
17524,Alan Simpson,"An educated man ... is thoroughly inoculated against humbug, thinks for himself and tries to give his thoughts, in speech or on paper, some style."

17537,Edith Sitwell,"My personal hobbies are reading, listening to music, and silence."
17538,Edith Sitwell,"Eccentricity is not, as dull people would have us believe, a form of madness. It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd."
17539,Edith Sitwell,Good taste is the worst vice ever invented.

17545,Sitting Bull,What treaty have the Sioux made with the white man that we have broken Not one. What treaty have the white man ever made with us that they have kept Not one. When I was a boy the Sioux owned the world the sun rose and set on their land they sent ten thousand men to battle. Where are the warriors today Who slew them Where are our lands Who owns them....What law have I broken Is it wrong for me to love my own Is it wicked for me because my skin is red Because I am a Sioux because I was born where my father lived because I would die for my people and my country

17554,Samuel Smiles,"It is possible that the scrupulously honest man may not grow rich so fast as the unscrupulous and dishonest one but the success will be of a truer kind, earned without fraud or injustice.

17579,Hannah Whitall Smith,"Let me advise thee not to talk of thyself as being old. There is something in Mind Cure, after all, and if thee continually talks of thyself as being old, thee may perhaps bring on some of the infirmities of age. At least I would not risk it if I were thee."

17606,Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn,"One should never direct people towards happiness, because happiness too is an idol of the market-place. One should direct them towards mutual affection.

My hope arises from the freeness of grace, and not from the freedom of the will."
17655,Charles Haddon Spurgeon,"It will be an ill day when our brethren take to bragging and boasting and call it 'testimony to the victorious Christian life.'

17685,Cornelius Stam,"The true Church is not an organization, nor does one join it through the noisy mechanics of denominational machinery. Rather it is a living organism, a body, and believers are joined to it by the quiet working of the Holy Spirit."
17686,Cornelius Stam,"We are living in a day of self-seeking and irresponsibility, even in Christian circles. Few indeed are the Christian believers who have truly laid their all on the altar for Christ. Few are the spiritual leaders who truly put God FIRST . Rather they think first, albeit subconsciously, of their positions, popularity, salaries and the success of the organizations over which they preside. While professing strong allegiance to God and His Word, they are nevertheless careful not to emphasize those passages from the Word which might ruffle feathers or rock the boat, as we say. In spite of their professed fidelity to God's Word and will, their first objective is actually to keep their organizations running smoothly and pleasantly so that they may continue to grow in numbers. This has become a way of life in Christendom, but in this matter too we should 'search the Scriptures daily,' to determine whether these things have God's approval, for however good and right a thing may seem, if it is at variance with the Word, rightly divided, it is contrary to the will of God and therefore wrong."
17687,Cornelius Stam,"Our first responsibility is not to build the Church or even to get souls saved--it is to represent Christ and to bring His message to the world. As God beholds us in Christ, so the world must behold Christ in us. As Christ represents us before the Father, so we must represent Christ before the world."
17688,Cornelius Stam,"Through His redemptive work we are 'justified from all things' (Acts 1338,39) and now rejoice in 'the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace' (Eph. 17), a position in Christ at God's right hand (Eph. 24-6), 'all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ' (Eph. 13) and 'the hope of the glory of God' (Rom. 52), to be fully realized when we are 'caught up together...to meet the Lord in the air' (1 Thess. 417). Then will be fulfilled the desire of God's loving heart 'That in the ages to come He might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus' (Eph. 27)."
17689,Cornelius Stam,"We can often tell by a man's walk whose son he is, and we should walk so that men about us will know that we are the children of God. One thing is certain--our stand for the truth will mean little if our conduct does not harmonize with our testimony."
17690,Cornelius Stam,"Not only as each new year dawns, but constantly, persistently, the God of all grace urges His blood-bought children to give themselves to Him in complete surrender and so to prove to themselves how much more blessed it is to yield to His will than to indulge in their own."
17691,Cornelius Stam,"The salvation of the lost is not best accomplished by great popular campaigns, conducted by a small minority of specialists in public evangelism, but by the godly, honest witness of believers individually. It is pure irresponsibility to leave the evangelization of the lost to the 'experts,' as many are doing today. God would have every believer do his part to win the lost to Christ by prayer, personal witness and sincere godliness."
17692,Cornelius Stam,"When Paul went to the Jew first, it was not because it seemed that Israel might yet accept Christ and His kingdom, but simply because God would leave Israel no excuse for rejecting Messiah. Paul confirmed Peter's message, and mightily contended with the Jews everywhere that 'Jesus is the Christ.' And miracles accompanied this confirmation testimony--greater miracles, indeed, than Peter himself had wrought. But, unlike Peter, Paul never offered the kingdom to Israel. His ministry among them was not to turn the nation to Christ, but to save any from among them who might believe, receiving salvation by grace, and to leave the rest without excuse. Thus God was concluding Israel in unbelief and, even at that early date, mightily using Paul to proclaim grace to the Gentiles."

17700,Elizabeth Cady Stanton,"Love is the vital essence that pervades and permeates, from the center to the circumference, the graduating circles of all thought and action. Love is the talisman of human weal and woe--the open sesame to every soul."

17744,Alexander Hamilton Stephens,"The real object of those who resorted to Secession, as well as those who sustained it, was not to overthrow the Government of the United States but to perpetuate the principles upon which it was founded. The object in quitting the Union was not to destroy, but to save the principles of the Constitution."
17745,Alexander Hamilton Stephens,"It was no Insurrection or Rebellion, or even Civil War in any proper sense of these terms... The war... was a war between States regularly organized into two separate Federal Republics... In the beginning, and throughout the contest, the object of the 'Confederates' was to maintain the separate Sovereignty of each State, and the right of self-government, which that necessarily carries with it. The object of the 'Federals,' on the contrary, was to maintain a Centralized Sovereignty over all the States on both sides. This was the fundamental principle involved in the Conflict, which must be kept continually in mind."

These are social and political faiths that are part of me, as they are, I suppose, part of all of us. Such beliefs are easy to express. But part of me too is my relation to all life, my religion. And this is not so easy to talk about. Religious experience is highly intimate and, for me, ready words are not at hand."

17787,I. F. Stone,When you are younger you get blamed for crimes you never committed and when you're older you begin to get credit for virtues you never possessed. It evens itself out.
17788,I. F. Stone,"The youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon, or, perchance, a palace or temple on the earth, and, at length, the middle-aged man concludes to build a woodshed with them."
17789,I. F. Stone,"Those who set out nobly to be their brother's keeper sometimes end up by becoming his jailer. Every emancipation has in it the seeds of a new slavery, and every truth easily becomes a lie."
17790,I. F. Stone,"If you live long enough, the venerability factor creeps in first, you get accused of things you never did, and later, credited for virtues you never had."
17791,J. Michael Straczynski,"No dictator, no invader, can hold an imprisoned population by force of arms forever. There is no greater power in the universe than the need for freedom. Against that power, governments and tyrants and armies cannot stand. The Centauri learned this lesson once. We will teach it to them again. Though it take a thousand years, we will be free."
17792,J. Michael Straczynski,"Take care, don't fight, and remember if you do not choose to lead, you will forever be led by others. Find what scares you, and do it. And you can make a difference, if you choose to do so."
17793,J. Michael Straczynski,"Never follow somebody else's path it doesn't work the same way twice for anyone...the path follows you and rolls up behind you as you walk, forcing the next person to find their own way."
17794,J. Michael Straczynski,"People spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy finding excuses for not being what they are capable of being, and not enough energy putting themselves on the line, growing out of the past, and getting on with their lives."
17795,J. Michael Straczynski,The quality of our thoughts is bordered on all sides by our facility with language.
17796,Leland Stowe,An American will tinker with anything he can put his hands on. But how rarely can he be persuaded to tinker with an abstract idea.

17808,Strugatsky,"When I feel bad, I work. When I have problems, when I'm depressed, when I'm bored with life, I sit down to my work. There are probably other prescriptions, but I don't know them. Or they don't work for me. You want my advice -- here it is Go and work. Thank God that people like you and me need only paper and pencil to work."
17809,Barbra Streisand,"The moral immune system of this country has been weakened and attacked, and the AIDS virus is the perfect metaphor for it. The malignant neglect of the last twelve years has led to breakdown of our country's immune system, environmentally, culturally, politically, spiritually and physically."
17810,Barbra Streisand,"A human being is only interesting if he's in contact with himself. I learned you have to trust yourself, be what you are, and do what you ought to do the way you should do it. You have got to discover you, what you do, and trust it."

You cannot touch love either, But you feel the sweetness that it pours into everything."

17856,Charles R. Swindoll,"People who soar are those who refuse to sit back, sigh and wish things would change. They neither complain of their lot nor passively dream of some distant ship coming in. Rather, they visualize in their minds that they are not quitters they will not allow life's circumstances to push them down and hold them under."
17857,Charles R. Swindoll,"Rejoicing is clearly a spiritual command. To ignore it, I need to remind you, is disobedience."
17858,Charles R. Swindoll,"The remarkable thing we have is a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past... We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude."

There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes."

18030,James Grover Thurber,"But those rare souls whose spirit gets magically into the hearts of men, leave behind them something more real and warmly personal than bodily presence, an ineffable and eternal thing.

18056,Alexis Charles Henri Clrel de Tocqueville,"Whoever has inhabited the United States must have perceived that in those parts of the Union in which the Negroes are no longer slaves the have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites.

18057,Alexis Charles Henri Clrel de Tocqueville,"...The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the Negroes in almost all the states in which slavery has been abolished, but if they come forward to vote, their lives are in danger...

18079,Alvin Toffler,Anyone nit-picking enough to write a letter of correction to an editor doubtless deserves the error that provoked it.

18150,Dr. Dale E. Turner,"God does not judge us by the multitude of works we perform, but how well we do the work that is ours to do. The happiness of too many days is often destroyed by trying to accomplish too much in one day. We would do well to follow a common rule for our daily lives--DO LESS, AND DO IT BETTER."
18151,Dr. Dale E. Turner,"Why is it that, as we grow older, we are so relunctant to change It is not so much that new ideas are painful, for they are not. It is that old ideas are seldom entirely false, but have truth, great truth in them.

18157,Dr. Dale E. Turner,"It is important to live each day with a positive perspective. It is not wise to pretend problems do not exist, but it is wise to look beyond the problem to the possibilities that are in it.

18158,Dr. Dale E. Turner,"The greatest of all faults is to be conscious of none. Recognizing our limitations and imperfections is the first requisite of progress. Those who believe they have arrived believe they have nowhere to go. Some not only have closed their minds to new truth, but they sit on the lid."
18159,Dr. Dale E. Turner,"In all the work we do, our most valuable asset can be the attitude of self-examination. It is forgivable to make mistakes, but to stand fast behind a wall of self-righteousness and make the same mistake twice is not forgivable."

18181,Brenda Ueland,"So you see, imagination needs moodling - long, inefficient, happy idling, dawdling and puttering."
18182,Brenda Ueland,"Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. When we really listen to people there is an alternating current, and this recharges us so that we never get tired of each other. We are constantly being re-created."
18183,Brenda Ueland,"I learned...that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness."

You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' or 'how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."

18780,Bill Watterson,"Why waste time learning, when ignorance is instantaneous - Calvin"
18781,Bill Watterson,"Some people are pragmatists, taking things as they come and making the best of the choices available.

18793,Alan B. Watts,"According to conviction, I am not simply what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost more the real me than what I am at this moment. For what I am seems so fleeting and intangible, but what I was is fixed and final.

18815,Daniel Webster,"Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of authority.

The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better ideas. The source of better ideas is wisdom. The surest path to wisdom is a liberal education."
18958,Dennis Wholey,Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are a good person is a little like expecting the bull not to attack you because you are a vegetarian.

18976,Emil Wiechert,"So far as modern science is concerned, we have to abandon completely the idea that by going into the realm of the small we shall reach the ultimate foundations of the universe.

19001,Oscar Fingall O'Flahertie Wills Wilde,"The mere mechanical technique of acting can be taught, but the spirit that is to give life to lifeless forms must be born in a man.

19002,Oscar Fingall O'Flahertie Wills Wilde,"Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them.

19027,Oscar Fingall O'Flahertie Wills Wilde,"Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it.

19076,Marianne Williamson,Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.
19077,Marianne Williamson,"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,talented and fabulous Actually, who are you not to be You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure about you. We were born to manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."

19088,Woodrow Wilson,"The way you let your hand rest in mine, my bewitching Sweetheart, fills me with happiness. It is the perfection of confiding love.

20465,Barbara Hall,"You're alive. Do something. The directive in life, the moral imperative was so uncomplicated. It could be expressed in single words, not complete sentences. It sounded like this Look. Listen. Choose. Act."
20466,Barbara Hall,"It's funny, to me, the way people refer to childbirth as a miraculous event. A miracle is something that defies nature. Only, childbirth has got to be the most natural thing in the world. Top three anyway. But, on the other hand, when you think about it, there's really no other word that fits. Sperm. Egg. A coincidental meshing of genetic information that will grow something that could write an opera or cook up some Napalm. It blows my mind."

The largest property may be wrested from a child, but virtue will stand by him to the last."

21537,Andrew Schneider,"Life here is so elemental. So real. Without the interference of civilization you can really experience things like,...silence. Silence and darkness in its purity. Right now, right outside my window all I can see is a black void. Endless darkness. It's totally exhilarating, and I feel very lucky to be here. Very, very lucky."
21538,Andrew Schneider,"Well, you're either lovers or you're wanting to be lovers or you're trying not to be lovers so you can be friends, but any way you look at it, sex is always looming in the picture like a shadow, like an undertow."
21539,Andrew Schneider,"Life is everywhere. The earth is throbbing with it, it's like music. The plants, the creatures, the ones we see, the ones we don't see, it's like one, big, pulsating symphony."
21540,Andrew Schneider,"Life's dirty. Life's unclean you know. It's birth, it's sex, it's the intestinal tract. One big squishy, unsanitary mess. It never gets any cleaner either. You know, dust to dust, worms crawl in, worms crawl out, right Even though we know that, we still walk the walk, we still live the life. We're like a bunch of little kids. Little kids, you know, we jump in this big old pond of mud and we're slapping it all over our face, rubbing our hair all down our backs and we're making these glorious, gooey, mud pies. That's us."
21541,Andrew Schneider,"Weird, isn't it Somehow in the dead of winter when its 40 below, so cold your words just freeze in the air, you think you'll never hear a robin's song again or see a blossom on a cherry tree, when one day you wake up and bingo, light coming through the mini blinds is softened with a tick of rose and the cold morning air has lost its bite. It's spring once again, the streets are paved with mud and the hills are alive with the sound of mosquitos."
21542,Andrew Schneider,"I feel like I can handle a lot of things. I can handle a parasitic infection and separating lesions, arterial sclerosis. But this stuff...I just want to go through life thinking people are happy, naive as that may sound."
21543,Andrew Schneider,"It's just human. We all have the jungle inside of us. We all have wants and needs and desires, strange as they may seem. If you stop to think about it, we're all pretty creative, cooking up all these fantasies. it's like a kind of poetry."
21544,Andrew Schneider,"Time for the weather report. It's cold out folks. Bonecrushing cold. The kind of cold which will wrench the spirit out of a young man, or forge it into steel."
21545,Andrew Schneider,"But then there's a moment like tonight, a profound and transcendent experience, the feeling as if a door has opened, and it's all because of that instrument, that incredible, magical instrument."
21546,Andrew Schneider,"There were always people like the pope. They serve a certain function, of course. They subsidize us. But, they don't create anything and they must never be allowed to stop the artist from creating."
21547,Andrew Schneider,"They didn't need men because they had each other, a significant other. It doesn't matter if the cat's in pants or pedal-pushers. I don't think we're supposed to fly solo."
21548,Andrew Schneider,"Hey, what do you think drives all this grey matter up here Electricity. It's brain waves surfing on synaptic junctions. If your radio can go out because of sun spots, why can't your cerebellum It's all a matter of reception and it seems to me these signals are going to get crossed somehow. It's all logical."
21549,Andrew Schneider,"Marriage is the union of disparate elements. Male and female. Yin and yang. Proton and electron. What are we talking about here Nothing less than the very tension that binds the universe. You see, when we look at marriage, people, we're are looking at creation itself. I am the sky, says the Hindu bridegroom to the bride. You are the earth. We are sky and earth united.... You are my husband. You are my wife. My feet shall run because of you. My feet shall dance because of you. My heart shall beat because of you. My eyes see because of you. My mind thinks because of you and I shall love because of you."
21550,Andrew Schneider,"Trees like to have kids climb on them, but trees are much bigger than we are, and much more forgiving."
21551,Andrew Schneider,Marriage. It's a hard term to define. Especially for me--I've ducked it like root canal. Still there's no denying the fact that marriage ranks right up there with birth and death as one of the three biggies in the human safari. It's the only one though that we'll celebrate with a conscious awareness. Very few of you remember your arrival and even fewer of you will attend your own funeral.
21552,Andrew Schneider,"Ever since we crawled out of that primordial slime, that's been our unifying cry, More light. Sunlight. Torchlight. Candlight. Neon, incandescent lights that banish the darkness from our caves to illuminate our roads, the insides of our refrigerators. Big floods for the night games at Soldier's field. Little tiny flashlights for those books we read under the covers when we're supposed to be asleep. Light is more than watts and footcandles. Light is metaphor. Light is knowledge, light is life, light is light."
21553,Andrew Schneider,"Despite everything I've achieved in my life, the culinary awards, the military commendations, the honorary degrees, I have never, ever lost sight of what's truly important. The thing that gives meaning to these triumphs. Someone to share them with. A companion. A help mate. A wife."
21554,Andrew Schneider,"I just have this feeling if I take pi, well past all this static, take pi to 10 million, 20 million digits, that I'll find something really incredible. Not just a pattern, not just an order, but a sign. A mathematical sign."
21555,Andrew Schneider,"I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't think you can measure life in terms of years. I think longevity doesn't necessarily have anything to do with happiness. I mean happiness comes from facing challenges and going out on a limb and taking risks. If you're not willing to take a risk for something you really care about, you might as well be dead."
21556,Andrew Schneider,"A person has three choices in life. You can swim against the tide and get exhausted, or you can tread water and let the tide sweep you away, or you can swim with the tide, and let it take you where it wants you to go."
21557,Andrew Schneider,"Continuous unremitting darkness has been known to send some people into an emotional tailspin, so the management here at KBHR radio suggests locking away the firearms. The desire to stick that 45 between the teeth can get pretty strong at times, so why invite temptation."
21558,Andrew Schneider,"Real meaningful endeavours, the biggies in human existence, often require the sacrifice of others."
21559,Andrew Schneider,"I used to think of all the billions of people in the world, and of all those people, how was I going to meet the right ones The right ones to be my friends, the right one to be my husband. Now I just believe you meet the people you're supposed to meet."
21560,Andrew Schneider,"As a doctor, as a man of science, I can tell you there is no such thing as curses Everything just happens as a question of probability. The statistical likelihood of a specific event."
21561,Andrew Schneider,"I'm grateful to you. If it weren't for you, I'd be in Cicely right now and I'd still be running that rat race, still locked in that commute. I'd be totally stressed, I'd be totally ignorant of what my life could be. I'm happier now than I've ever been."
21562,Andrew Schneider,"There can be no spirituality, no sanctity, no truth without the female sex."
21563,Andrew Schneider,I always admired atheists. I think it takes a lot of faith.
21564,Andrew Schneider,"She gave me more than just a sweater vest that night. She gave me all this. Nothing. She gave me nothing. That's what I need. No phone book, no Game Boy, no pasta maker, TV Guide. Nowhere to go, nothing to do."
21565,Andrew Schneider,"Sometimes the mind, for reasons we don't necessarily understand, just decides to go to the store for a quart of milk."
21566,Andrew Schneider,Marriage. It's like a cultural hand-rail. It links folks to the past and guides them to the future.
21567,Andrew Schneider,"The vow of silence, that's the mind-blower. See, talking is what I do... i t's a real need with me, a craving, I'm like a word junkie. I never shut up. I talk to myself, I talk in my sleep. The idea of voluntarily turning off that tap, I can't imagine it It'd be like, I don't know, all the rivers in the world just slammed to a stop. No churning, no flowing, no white water, just stillness, crushing stillness. I don't think I could stand it, locked up like that in my own psyche. I'd collapse into myself, I'd implode"
21568,Andrew Schneider,"What are man and woman if not members of two very different and warring tribes Yet decade after decade, century after century, they attempt in marriage to reconcile and forge a union. Why I don't know. Biological imperative Divine law Or just a desire to connect to that mysterious other In any case, it's always struck me as a hopeful thing."
21569,Andrew Schneider,"Listen, can you hear it Spring's sweet cantata. The strains of grass pushing through the snow. The song of buds swelling on the vine. The tender timpani of a baby robin's heart. Spring."
21570,Andrew Schneider,"Greetings on this most exceedingly beautiful spring morning. A morning swollen with new life, a morning on which, if I had the voice, I would let loose with song. It's hard to believe just a few short weeks ago we were eating our cornflakes in the wintery dark. Now, well it's still kind of dim out there, but I can see the golden glow of Apollo's chariot waiting in the wings, about to make its entrance. Winter's on the lam, no doubt."
21571,Andrew Schneider,"Let's not kid ourselves. Whatever we diagnose, most patients, if they don't die, get well by themselves. Our job is mainly to try to make them feel better do no harm."
21572,Andrew Schneider,"As a scientist, I am not sure anymore that life can be reduced to a class struggle, to dialectical materialism, or any set of formulas. Life is spontaneous and it is unpredictable, it is magical. I think that we have struggled so hard with the tangible that we have forgotten the intangible."
21573,William A. Smith,"Engineering is the science of economy, of conserving the energy, kinetic and potential, provided and stored up by nature for the use of man. It is the business of engineering to utilize this energy to the best advantage, so that there may be the least possible waste."

21650,James Thurber,"I loathe the expression What makes him tick. It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.

In real life there are no fogbound moors or clues on matchbooks or fifth columnists waiting to be unmasked. it would be nice if here were, because then there would be solutions to things in life, but it doesn't always work that way. Everyone likes a good detective story. I went through my Hammett phase in college. I think the attraction is, in life our mysteries aren't exciting. You know They're just intractable and depressing and enervating. Like, why do we always hurt the ones we love. Where does the money go ...in a detective story, at least the universe makes sense.

21720,Jeffrey Vlaming,"Dateline Mesopotamia, 3500 B.C. That's when the multi-faceted sounds we call music got its humble beginnings. It seems clappers were sent out the the fields to scare evil spirits away. These clappers started getting into the beat of their duty and, bingo, you got drums.
